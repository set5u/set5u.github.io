Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License.",

For that simple use-case, you can check out [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com), our batteries-included approach to deploying static sites on Cloudflare's edge network. Workers Sites was designed as a precursor to Cloudflare Pages, so check out Pages if you just want to deploy your static site without any special customizations!\n\nFor users who _do_ want to customize their assets, and want to build complex experiences on top of their static assets, `kv-asset-handler` (and the default [Workers Sites template](https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-sites-template), which is provided for use with Wrangler + Workers Sites) allows you to customize caching behavior, headers, and anything else about how your Workers function loads the static assets for your site stored in Workers KV.\n\nThe Cloudflare Workers Discord server is an active place where Workers users get help, share feedback, and collaborate on making our platform better. The `#workers` channel in particular is a great place to chat about `kv-asset-handler`, and building cool experiences for your users using these tools! If you have questions, want to share what you're working on, or give feedback, [join us in Discord and say hello](https://discord.cloudflare.com)!\n\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n- [`getAssetFromKV`](#getassetfromkv)\n  - [Example](#example)\n  * [Return](#return)\n  * [Optional Arguments](#optional-arguments)\n    - [`mapRequestToAsset`](#maprequesttoasset)\n    - [Example](#example-1)\n    - [`cacheControl`](#cachecontrol)\n      - [`browserTTL`](#browserttl)\n      - [`edgeTTL`](#edgettl)\n      - [`bypassCache`](#bypasscache)\n    - [`ASSET_NAMESPACE` (required for ES Modules)](#asset_namespace-required-for-es-modules)\n    - [`ASSET_MANIFEST` (required for ES Modules)](#asset_manifest-required-for-es-modules)\n    - [`defaultETag`](#defaultetag-optional)\n\n* [Helper functions](#helper-functions)\n  - [`mapRequestToAsset`](#maprequesttoasset-1)\n  - [`serveSinglePageApp`](#servesinglepageapp)\n* [Cache revalidation and etags](#cache-revalidation-and-etags)\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd this package to your `package.json` by running this in the root of your\nproject's directory:\n\n```\nnpm i @cloudflare/kv-asset-handler\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThis package was designed to work with [Worker Sites](https://workers.cloudflare.com/sites).\n\n## `getAssetFromKV`\n\ngetAssetFromKV(Evt) => Promise<Response>\n\n`getAssetFromKV` is an async function that takes an `Evt` object (containing a `Request` and a [`waitUntil`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/fetch-event#waituntil)) and returns a `Response` object if the request matches an asset in KV, otherwise it will throw a `KVError`.\n\n#### Example\n\nThis example checks for the existence of a value in KV, and returns it if it's there, and returns a 404 if it is not. It also serves index.html from `/`.\n\n### Return\n\n`getAssetFromKV` returns a `Promise<Response>` with `Response` being the body of the asset requested.\n\nKnown errors to be thrown are:\n\n- MethodNotAllowedError\n- NotFoundError\n- InternalError\n\n#### ES Modules\n\n```js\nimport manifestJSON from \"__STATIC_CONTENT_MANIFEST\";\nimport {\n\tgetAssetFromKV,\n\tMethodNotAllowedError,\n\tNotFoundError,\n} from \"@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler\";\n\nconst assetManifest = JSON.parse(manifestJSON);\n\nexport default {\n\tasync fetch(request, env, ctx) {\n\t\tif (request.url.includes(\"/docs\")) {\n\t\t\ttry {\n\t\t\t\treturn await getAssetFromKV(\n\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\trequest,\n\t\t\t\t\t\twaitUntil(promise) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn ctx.waitUntil(promise);\n\t\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\tASSET_NAMESPACE: env.__STATIC_CONTENT,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tASSET_MANIFEST: assetManifest,\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t);\n\t\t\t} catch (e) {\n\t\t\t\tif (e instanceof NotFoundError) {\n\t\t\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t\t\t} else if (e instanceof MethodNotAllowedError) {\n\t\t\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\t\treturn new Response(\"An unexpected error occurred\", { status: 500 });\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t} else return fetch(request);\n\t},\n};\n```\n\n#### Service Worker\n\n```js\nimport {\n\tgetAssetFromKV,\n\tMethodNotAllowedError,\n\tNotFoundError,\n} from \"@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler\";\n\naddEventListener(\"fetch\", (event) => {\n\tevent.respondWith(handleEvent(event));\n});\n\nasync function handleEvent(event) {\n\tif (event.request.url.includes(\"/docs\")) {\n\t\ttry {\n\t\t\treturn await getAssetFromKV(event);\n\t\t} catch (e) {\n\t\t\tif (e instanceof NotFoundError) {\n\t\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t\t} else if (e instanceof MethodNotAllowedError) {\n\t\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\treturn new Response(\"An unexpected error occurred\", { status: 500 });\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t} else return fetch(event.request);\n}\n```\n\n### Optional Arguments\n\nYou can customize the behavior of `getAssetFromKV` by passing the following properties as an object into the second argument.\n\n```\ngetAssetFromKV(event, { mapRequestToAsset: ... })\n```\n\n#### `mapRequestToAsset`\n\nmapRequestToAsset(Request) => Request\n\nMaps the incoming request to the value that will be looked up in Cloudflare's KV\n\nBy default, mapRequestToAsset is set to the exported function [`mapRequestToAsset`](#maprequesttoasset-1). This works for most static site generators, but you can customize this behavior by passing your own function as `mapRequestToAsset`. The function should take a `Request` object as its only argument, and return a new `Request` object with an updated path to be looked up in the asset manifest/KV.\n\nFor SPA mapping pass in the [`serveSinglePageApp`](#servesinglepageapp) function\n\n#### Example\n\nStrip `/docs` from any incoming request before looking up an asset in Cloudflare's KV.\n\n```js\nimport { getAssetFromKV, mapRequestToAsset } from '@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler'\n...\nconst customKeyModifier = request => {\n  let url = request.url\n  //custom key mapping optional\n  url = url.replace('/docs', '').replace(/^\\/+/, '')\n  return mapRequestToAsset(new Request(url, request))\n}\nlet asset = await getAssetFromKV(event, { mapRequestToAsset: customKeyModifier })\n```\n\n#### `cacheControl`\n\ntype: object\n\n`cacheControl` allows you to configure options for both the Cloudflare Cache accessed by your Worker, and the browser cache headers sent along with your Workers' responses. The default values are as follows:\n\n```javascript\nlet cacheControl = {\n\tbrowserTTL: null, // do not set cache control ttl on responses\n\tedgeTTL: 2 * 60 * 60 * 24, // 2 days\n\tbypassCache: false, // do not bypass Cloudflare's cache\n};\n```\n\n##### `browserTTL`\n\ntype: number | null\nnullable: true\n\nSets the `Cache-Control: max-age` header on the response returned from the Worker. By default set to `null` which will not add the header at all.\n\n##### `edgeTTL`\n\ntype: number | null\nnullable: true\n\nSets the `Cache-Control: max-age` header on the response used as the edge cache key. By default set to 2 days (`2 * 60 * 60 * 24`). When null will not cache on the edge at all.\n\n##### `bypassCache`\n\ntype: boolean\n\nDetermines whether to cache requests on Cloudflare's edge cache. By default set to `false` (recommended for production builds). Useful for development when you need to eliminate the cache's effect on testing.\n\n#### `ASSET_NAMESPACE` (required for ES Modules)\n\ntype: KV Namespace Binding\n\nThe binding name to the KV Namespace populated with key/value entries of files for the Worker to serve. By default, Workers Sites uses a [binding to a Workers KV Namespace](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/reference/storage/api/#namespaces) named `__STATIC_CONTENT`.\n\nIt is further assumed that this namespace consists of static assets such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or image files, keyed off of a relative path that roughly matches the assumed URL pathname of the incoming request.\n\nIn ES Modules format, this argument is required, and can be gotten from `env`.\n\n##### ES Module\n\n```js\nreturn getAssetFromKV(\n\t{\n\t\trequest,\n\t\twaitUntil(promise) {\n\t\t\treturn ctx.waitUntil(promise)\n\t\t},\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\tASSET_NAMESPACE: env.__STATIC_CONTENT,\n\t},\n)\n```\n\n##### Service Worker\n\n```\nreturn getAssetFromKV(event, { ASSET_NAMESPACE: MY_NAMESPACE })\n```\n\n#### `ASSET_MANIFEST` (required for ES Modules)\n\ntype: text blob (JSON formatted) or object\n\nThe mapping of requested file path to the key stored on Cloudflare.\n\nWorkers Sites with Wrangler bundles up a text blob that maps request paths to content-hashed keys that are generated by Wrangler as a cache-busting measure. If this option/binding is not present, the function will fallback to using the raw pathname to look up your asset in KV. If, for whatever reason, you have rolled your own implementation of this, you can include your own by passing a stringified JSON object where the keys are expected paths, and the values are the expected keys in your KV namespace.\n\nIn ES Modules format, this argument is required, and can be imported.\n\n##### ES Module\n\n```js\nimport manifestJSON from '__STATIC_CONTENT_MANIFEST'\nlet manifest = JSON.parse(manifestJSON)\nmanifest['index.html'] = 'index.special.html'\n\nreturn getAssetFromKV(\n\t{\n\t\trequest,\n\t\twaitUntil(promise) {\n\t\t\treturn ctx.waitUntil(promise)\n\t\t},\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\tASSET_MANIFEST: manifest,\n\t\t// ...\n\t},\n)\n```\n\n##### Service Worker\n\n```\nlet assetManifest = { \"index.html\": \"index.special.html\" }\nreturn getAssetFromKV(event, { ASSET_MANIFEST: assetManifest })\n```\n\n#### `defaultMimeType` (optional)\n\ntype: string\n\nThis is the mime type that will be used for files with unrecognized or missing extensions. The default value is `'text/plain'`.\n\nIf you are serving a static site and would like to use extensionless HTML files instead of index.html files, set this to `'text/html'`.\n\n#### `defaultDocument` (optional)\n\ntype: string\n\nThis is the default document that will be concatenated for requests ends in `'/'` or without a valid mime type like `'/about'` or `'/about.me'`. The default value is `'index.html'`.\n\n#### `defaultETag` (optional)\n\ntype: `'strong' | 'weak'`\n\nThis determines the format of the response [ETag header](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag). If the resource is in the cache, the ETag will always be weakened before being returned.\nThe default value is `'strong'`.\n\n# Helper functions\n\n## `mapRequestToAsset`\n\nmapRequestToAsset(Request) => Request\n\nThe default function for mapping incoming requests to keys in Cloudflare's KV.\n\nTakes any path that ends in `/` or evaluates to an HTML file and appends `index.html` or `/index.html` for lookup in your Workers KV namespace.\n\n## `serveSinglePageApp`\n\nserveSinglePageApp(Request) => Request\n\nA custom handler for mapping requests to a single root: `index.html`. The most common use case is single-page applications - frameworks with in-app routing - such as React Router, VueJS, etc. It takes zero arguments.\n\n```js\nimport { getAssetFromKV, serveSinglePageApp } from '@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler'\n...\nlet asset = await getAssetFromKV(event, { mapRequestToAsset: serveSinglePageApp })\n```\n\n# Cache revalidation and etags\n\nAll responses served from cache (including those with `cf-cache-status: MISS`) include an `etag` response header that identifies the version of the resource. The `etag` value is identical to the path key used in the `ASSET_MANIFEST`. It is updated each time an asset changes and looks like this: `etag: <filename>.<hash of file contents>.<extension>` (ex. `etag: index.54321.html`).\n\nResources served with an `etag` allow browsers to use the `if-none-match` request header to make conditional requests for that resource in the future. This has two major benefits:\n\n- When a request's `if-none-match` value matches the `etag` of the resource in Cloudflare cache, Cloudflare will send a `304 Not Modified` response without a body, saving bandwidth.\n- Changes to a file on the server are immediately reflected in the browser - even when the cache control directive `max-age` is unexpired.\n\n#### Disable the `etag`\n\nTo turn `etags` **off**, you must bypass cache:\n\n```js\n/* Turn etags off */\nlet cacheControl = {\n\tbypassCache: true,\n};\n```\n\n#### Syntax and comparison context\n\n`kv-asset-handler` sets and evaluates etags as [strong validators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Conditional_requests#Strong_validation). To preserve `etag` integrity, the format of the value deviates from the [RFC2616 recommendation to enclose the `etag` with quotation marks](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-3.11). This is intentional. Cloudflare cache applies the `W/` prefix to all `etags` that use quoted-strings -- a process that converts the `etag` to a \"weak validator\" when served to a client.",

The most important commands are:\n\n| Command | Description |\n| ------- | ----------- |\n| `yarn test` | This will run lint, unit tests, and integration tests against the live environment|\n| `yarn test:<platform>` | Runs all browser tests, unit and integration |\n| `yarn test:<platform>:unit` | Runs only \\<platform> unit tests |\n| `yarn test:<platform>:unit:debug` | Runs \\<platform> unit tests, auto-watching for file system changes |\n| `yarn test:<platform>:integration` | Runs only integration tests against the live environment |\n| `yarn test:<platform>:integration:local` | Runs all headless \\<platform> integration tests against the emulator (more below) |\n| `yarn test:browser:integration:prodbackend` | Runs TOTP MFA integration tests against the backend (more below) |\n\nWhere \\<platform> is \"browser\" or \"node\". There are also cordova tests, but they\nare not broken into such granular details. Check out `package.json` for more.\n\n### Integration testing with the emulator\n\nTo test against the emulator, set up the Auth emulator\n([instructions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/connect_and_prototype)).\nThe easiest way to run these tests is to use the `firebase emulators:exec`\ncommand\n([documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/install_and_configure#startup)).\nYou can also manually start the emulator separately, and then point the tests\nto it by setting the `GCLOUD_PROJECT` and `FIREBASE_AUTH_EMULATOR_HOST`\nenvironmental variables. In addition to the commands listed above, the below\ncommands also run various tests:\n\n  * `yarn test:integration:local` — Executes Node and browser emulator\n    integration tests, as well as the Selenium WebDriver tests\n  \n  * `yarn test:webdriver` — Executes only the Selenium WebDriver\n    integration tests\n\nNote - The webdriver tests require the Chrome webdriver to match the version of Chrome running locally.\nIn the CI environment, this is ensured using the environment variable [here.](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/blob/6e80a678fe0c31046860554cec0459a2be34d22b/.github/workflows/test-changed-auth.yml#L7)\nWhen running locally, change the chromedriver version in [package.json](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/blob/6e80a678fe0c31046860554cec0459a2be34d22b/packages/auth/package.json#L124) to match your local Chrome version and run `yarn install`.\n\n\nFor example, to run all integration and WebDriver tests against the emulator,\nyou would simply execute the following command:\n\n```sh\nfirebase emulators:exec --project foo-bar --only auth \"yarn test:integration:local\"\n```\n\n### Integration testing with the production backend\n\nCurrently, MFA TOTP and password policy tests only run against the production backend (since they are not supported on the emulator yet).\nRunning against the backend also makes it a more reliable end-to-end test.\n\nThe TOTP tests require the following email/password combination to exist in the project, so if you are running this test against your test project, please create this user:\n\n'totpuser-donotdelete@test.com', 'password'\n\nYou also need to verify this email address, in order to use MFA. This can be done with a curl command like this:\n\n```\ncurl   -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)\"   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"   -H \"X-Goog-User-Project: ${PROJECT_ID}\"   -X POST https://identitytoolkit.googleapis.com/v1/accounts:sendOobCode   -d     '{\n      \"email\": \"totpuser-donotdelete@test.com\",\n      \"requestType\": \"VERIFY_EMAIL\",\n      \"returnOobLink\": true,\n    }'\n```\n\nThe password policy tests require a tenant configured with a password policy that requires all options to exist in the project.\n\nIf you are running this test against your test project, please create the tenant and configure the policy with the following curl command:\n\n```\ncurl   -H \"Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)\"   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"   -H \"X-Goog-User-Project: ${PROJECT_ID}\"   -X POST https://identitytoolkit.googleapis.com/v2/projects/${PROJECT_ID}/tenants   -d     '{\n      \"displayName\": \"passpol-tenant\",\n      \"passwordPolicyConfig\": {\n        \"passwordPolicyEnforcementState\": \"ENFORCE\",\n        \"passwordPolicyVersions\": [\n          {\n            \"customStrengthOptions\": {\n              \"minPasswordLength\": 8,\n              \"maxPasswordLength\": 24,\n              \"containsLowercaseCharacter\": true,\n              \"containsUppercaseCharacter\": true,\n              \"containsNumericCharacter\": true,\n              \"containsNonAlphanumericCharacter\": true\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }'\n```\n\nReplace the tenant ID `passpol-tenant-d7hha` in [test/integration/flows/password_policy.test.ts](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/blob/master/packages/auth/test/integration/flows/password_policy.test.ts) with the ID for the newly created tenant. The tenant ID can be found at the end of the `name` property in the response and is in the format `passpol-tenant-xxxxx`.\n\n### Selenium Webdriver tests\n\nThese tests assume that you have both Firefox and Chrome installed on your\ncomputer and in your `$PATH`. The tests will error out if this is not the case.\nThe WebDriver tests talk to the emulator, but unlike the headless integration\ntests, these run in a browser robot environment; the assertions themselves run\nin Node. When you run these tests a small Express server will be started to\nserve the static files the browser robot uses.",

Once they take that action, the log should go away.\n- `warn`: Use when a product feature may stop functioning correctly; unexpected\n  scenario.\n- `error`: Only use when user App would stop functioning correctly - super rare!\n\n## Log Format\n\nEach log will be formatted in the following manner:\n\n```typescript\n`[${new Date()}]  ${COMPONENT_NAME}: ${...args}`\n```",

    "description": "A Promise-compatible abstraction that defers resolving/rejecting promises to another closure.",
    "copyright": "",
    "licenseText": "# Deferred Promise\n\nThe `DeferredPromise` class is a Promise-compatible abstraction that defers resolving/rejecting promises to another closure. This class is primarily useful when one part of your system establishes as promise but another part of your system fulfills it.\n\n> This class is conceptually inspired by the [`createDeferredPromise()`](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/696fd4b14fc34cc2d01497a3abd9bb441b89be50/lib/internal/util.js#L468-L477) internal utility in Node.js. Unlike the Node.js implementation, however, `DeferredProimse` _extends_ a native `Promise`, allowing the consumer to handle deferred promises like regular promises (no `.promise` instance nesting).\n\n## Getting started\n\n```sh\nnpm install @open-draft/deferred-promise\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [**`createDeferredExecutor()`**](#createdeferredexecutor)\n  - [`DeferredExecutor.state`](#deferredexecutorstate)\n  - [`DeferredExecutor.resolve()`](#deferredexecutorresolve)\n  - [`DeferredExecutor.reject()`](#deferredexecutorreject)\n  - [`DeferredExecutor.rejectionReason`](#deferredexecutorrejectionreason)\n- [**Class: `DeferredPromise`**](#class-deferredpromise)\n  - [`new DeferredPromise()`](#new-defferedpromise)\n  - [`deferredPromise.state`](#deferredpromisestate)\n  - [`deferredPromise.resolve()`](#deferredpromiseresolve)\n  - [`deferredPromise.reject()`](#deferredpromisereject)\n  - [`deferredPromise.rejectionReason`](#deferredpromiserejectionreason)\n\n---\n\n## `createDeferredExecutor()`\n\nCreates a Promise executor function that delegates its resolution to the current scope.\n\n```js\nimport { createDeferredExecutor } from '@open-draft/deferred-promise'\n\nconst executor = createDeferredExecutor()\nconst promise = new Promise(executor)\n\nexecutor.resolve('hello')\n// executor.reject(new Error('Reason'))\n```\n\nDeferred executor allows you to control any promise remotely and doesn't affect the Promise instance in any way. Similar to the [`DeferredPromise`](#class-deferredpromise) instance, the deferred executor exposes additional promise properties like `state`, `rejectionReason`, `resolve`, and `reject`. In fact, the `DeferredPromise` class is implemented on top of the deferred executor.\n\n```js\nconst executor = createDeferredExecutor()\nconst promise = new Promise(executor)\n\nexecutor.reject('reason')\n\nnextTick(() => {\n  console.log(executor.rejectionReason) // \"reason\"\n})\n```\n\n### `DeferredExecutor.state`\n\n- `<\"pending\" | \"fulfilled\" | \"rejected\">` **Default:** `\"pending\"`\n\n```js\nconst executor = createDeferredExecutor()\nconst promise = new Promise(executor)\n\nconsole.log(executor.state) // \"pending\"\n```\n\nCalling [`resolve()`](#deferredexecutorresolve) and [`reject()`](#deferredexecutorreject) methods of the executor transitions the state to \"fulfilled\" and \"rejected\" respectively.\n\n### `DeferredExecutor.resolve()`\n\nResolves the promise with a given value.\n\n```js\nconst executor = createDeferredExecutor()\nconst promise = new Promise(executor)\n\nconsole.log(executor.state) // \"pending\"\n\nexecutor.resolve()\n\n// The promise state is still \"pending\"\n// because promises are settled in the next microtask.\nconsole.log(executor.state) // \"pending\"\n\nnextTick(() => {\n  // In the next microtask, the promise's state is resolved.\n  console.log(executor.state) // \"fulfilled\"\n})\n```\n\n### `DeferredExecutor.reject()`\n\nRejects the promise with a given reason.\n\n```js\nconst executor = createDeferredExecutor()\nconst promise = new Promise(executor)\n\nexecutor.reject(new Error('Failed to fetch'))\n\nnextTick(() => {\n  console.log(executor.state) // \"rejected\"\n  console.log(executor.rejectionReason) // Error(\"Failed to fetch\")\n})\n```\n\nYou can access the rejection reason of the promise at any time by the [`rejectionReason`](#deferredexecutorrejectionreason) property of the deferred executor.\n\n### `DeferredExecutor.rejectionReason`\n\nReturns the reason of the promise rejection. If no reason has been provided to the `reject()` call, `undefined` is returned instead.\n\n```js\nconst executor = createDeferredExecutor()\nconst promise = new Promise(executor)\n\npromise.reject(new Error('Internal Server Error'))\n\nnextTick(() => {\n  console.log(promise.rejectionReason) // Error(\"Internal Server Error\")\n})\n```\n\n---\n\n## Class: `DeferredPromise`\n\n### `new DefferedPromise()`\n\nCreates a new instance of a deferred promise.\n\n```js\nimport { DeferredPromise } from '@open-draft/deferred-promise'\n\nconst promise = new DeferredPromise()\n```\n\nA deferred promise is a Promise-compatible class that constructs a regular Promise instance under the hood, controlling it via the [deferred executor](#createdeferredexecutor).\n\nA deferred promise is fully compatible with the regular Promise, both type- and runtime-wise, e.g. a deferred promise can be chained and awaited normally.\n\n```js\nconst promise = new DefferredPromise()\n  .then((value) => value.toUpperCase())\n  .then((value) => value.substring(0, 2))\n  .catch((error) => console.error(error))\n\nawait promise\n```\n\nUnlike the regular Promise, however, a deferred promise doesn't accept the `executor` function as the constructor argument. Instead, the resolution of the deferred promise is deferred to the current scope (thus the name).\n\n```js\nfunction getPort() {\n  // Notice that you don't provide any executor function\n  // when constructing a deferred promise.\n  const portPromise = new DeferredPromise()\n\n  port.on('open', (port) => {\n    // Resolve the deferred promise whenever necessary.\n    portPromise.resolve(port)\n  })\n\n  // Return the deferred promise immediately.\n  return portPromise\n}\n```\n\nUse the [`resolve()`](#deferredpromiseresolve) and [`reject()`](#deferredpromisereject) methods of the deferred promise instance to resolve and reject that promise respectively.\n\n### `deferredPromise.state`\n\nSee [`DeferredExecutor.state`](#deferredexecutorstate)\n\n### `deferredPromise.resolve()`\n\nSee [`DeferredExecutor.resolve()`](#deferredexecutorresolve)\n\n### `deferredPromise.reject()`\n\nSee [`DeferredExecutor.reject()`](#deferredexecutorreject)\n\n### `deferredPromise.rejectionReason`\n\nSee [`DeferredExecutor.rejectionReason`](#deferredexecutorrejectionreason)\n\n---\n\n## Mentions\n\n- [Jonas Kuske](https://github.com/jonaskuske) for the phenomenal work around improving Promise-compliance.",

    "copyright": "",
    "licenseText": "# @parcel/watcher\n\nA native C++ Node module for querying and subscribing to filesystem events. Used by [Parcel 2](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel).\n\n## Features\n\n- **Watch** - subscribe to realtime recursive directory change notifications when files or directories are created, updated, or deleted.\n- **Query** - performantly query for historical change events in a directory, even when your program is not running.\n- **Native** - implemented in C++ for performance and low-level integration with the operating system.\n- **Cross platform** - includes backends for macOS, Linux, Windows, FreeBSD, and Watchman.\n- **Performant** - events are throttled in C++ so the JavaScript thread is not overwhelmed during large filesystem changes (e.g. `git checkout` or `npm install`).\n- **Scalable** - tens of thousands of files can be watched or queried at once with good performance.\n\n## Example\n\n```javascript\nconst watcher = require('@parcel/watcher');\nconst path = require('path');\n\n// Subscribe to events\nlet subscription = await watcher.subscribe(process.cwd(), (err, events) => {\n  console.log(events);\n});\n\n// later on...\nawait subscription.unsubscribe();\n\n// Get events since some saved snapshot in the past\nlet snapshotPath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'snapshot.txt');\nlet events = await watcher.getEventsSince(process.cwd(), snapshotPath);\n\n// Save a snapshot for later\nawait watcher.writeSnapshot(process.cwd(), snapshotPath);\n```\n\n## Watching\n\n`@parcel/watcher` supports subscribing to realtime notifications of changes in a directory. It works recursively, so changes in sub-directories will also be emitted.\n\nEvents are throttled and coalesced for performance during large changes like `git checkout` or `npm install`, and a single notification will be emitted with all of the events at the end.\n\nOnly one notification will be emitted per file. For example, if a file was both created and updated since the last event, you'll get only a `create` event. If a file is both created and deleted, you will not be notifed of that file. Renames cause two events: a `delete` for the old name, and a `create` for the new name.\n\n```javascript\nlet subscription = await watcher.subscribe(process.cwd(), (err, events) => {\n  console.log(events);\n});\n```\n\nEvents have two properties:\n\n- `type` - the event type: `create`, `update`, or `delete`.\n- `path` - the absolute path to the file or directory.\n\nTo unsubscribe from change notifications, call the `unsubscribe` method on the returned subscription object.\n\n```javascript\nawait subscription.unsubscribe();\n```\n\n`@parcel/watcher` has the following watcher backends, listed in priority order:\n\n- [FSEvents](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreservices/file_system_events) on macOS\n- [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) if installed\n- [inotify](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/inotify.7.html) on Linux\n- [ReadDirectoryChangesW](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365465%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx) on Windows\n- [kqueue](https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?kqueue) on FreeBSD, or as an alternative to FSEvents on macOS\n\nYou can specify the exact backend you wish to use by passing the `backend` option. If that backend is not available on the current platform, the default backend will be used instead. See below for the list of backend names that can be passed to the options.\n\n## Querying\n\n`@parcel/watcher` also supports querying for historical changes made in a directory, even when your program is not running. This makes it easy to invalidate a cache and re-build only the files that have changed, for example. It can be **significantly** faster than traversing the entire filesystem to determine what files changed, depending on the platform.\n\nIn order to query for historical changes, you first need a previous snapshot to compare to. This can be saved to a file with the `writeSnapshot` function, e.g. just before your program exits.\n\n```javascript\nawait watcher.writeSnapshot(dirPath, snapshotPath);\n```\n\nWhen your program starts up, you can query for changes that have occurred since that snapshot using the `getEventsSince` function.\n\n```javascript\nlet events = await watcher.getEventsSince(dirPath, snapshotPath);\n```\n\nThe events returned are exactly the same as the events that would be passed to the `subscribe` callback (see above).\n\n`@parcel/watcher` has the following watcher backends, listed in priority order:\n\n- [FSEvents](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreservices/file_system_events) on macOS\n- [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) if installed\n- [fts](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/fts.3.html) (brute force) on Linux and FreeBSD\n- [FindFirstFile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-findfirstfilea) (brute force) on Windows\n\nThe FSEvents (macOS) and Watchman backends are significantly more performant than the brute force backends used by default on Linux and Windows, for example returning results in miliseconds instead of seconds for large directory trees. This is because a background daemon monitoring filesystem changes on those platforms allows us to query cached data rather than traversing the filesystem manually (brute force).\n\nmacOS has good performance with FSEvents by default. For the best performance on other platforms, install [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) and it will be used by `@parcel/watcher` automatically.\n\nYou can specify the exact backend you wish to use by passing the `backend` option. If that backend is not available on the current platform, the default backend will be used instead. See below for the list of backend names that can be passed to the options.\n\n## Options\n\nAll of the APIs in `@parcel/watcher` support the following options, which are passed as an object as the last function argument.\n\n- `ignore` - an array of paths or glob patterns to ignore. uses [`is-glob`](https://github.com/micromatch/is-glob) to distinguish paths from globs. glob patterns are parsed with [`micromatch`](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch) (see [features](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch#matching-features)).\n  - paths can be relative or absolute and can either be files or directories. No events will be emitted about these files or directories or their children.\n  - glob patterns match on relative paths from the root that is watched. No events will be emitted for matching paths.\n- `backend` - the name of an explicitly chosen backend to use. Allowed options are `\"fs-events\"`, `\"watchman\"`, `\"inotify\"`, `\"kqueue\"`, `\"windows\"`, or `\"brute-force\"` (only for querying). If the specified backend is not available on the current platform, the default backend will be used instead.\n\n## WASM\n\nThe `@parcel/watcher-wasm` package can be used in place of `@parcel/watcher` on unsupported platforms. It relies on the Node `fs` module, so in non-Node environments such as browsers, an `fs` polyfill will be needed.\n\n**Note**: the WASM implementation is significantly less efficient than the native implementations because it must crawl the file system to watch each directory individually. Use the native `@parcel/watcher` package wherever possible.\n\n```js\nimport {subscribe} from '@parcel/watcher-wasm';\n\n// Use the module as documented above.\nsubscribe(/* ... */);\n```\n\n## Who is using this?\n\n- [Parcel 2](https://parceljs.org/)\n- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_62#_file-watching-changes)\n- [Tailwind CSS Intellisense](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-intellisense)\n- [Gatsby Cloud](https://twitter.com/chatsidhartha/status/1435647412828196867)\n- [Nx](https://nx.dev)\n- [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com)\n\n## License\n\nMIT",

The returned object will always only contain the following keys: `search`, `query`, `pathname`, and `raw`.\n\n> **Note:** This library does not process `protocol`, `hostname`, `port`, etc.<br>This is because the incoming `req.url` value only begins with the path information.\n\nParsed requests will be mutated with a `_parsedUrl` key, containing the returned output. This is used for future memoization, avoiding the need to fully parse the same `url` value multiple times.\n\n## Install\n\n```\n$ npm install --save @polka/url\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst parse = require('@polka/url');\n\nlet req = {\n  url: '/foo/bar?fizz=buzz'\n};\nlet output = parse(req);\n//=> {\n//=>   pathname: '/foo/bar',\n//=>   raw: '/foo/bar?fizz=buzz',\n//=>   search: '?fizz=buzz',\n//=>   query: {\n//=>     fizz: 'buzz'\n//=>   },\n//=> }\n\n// Attaches result for future memoization\nassert.deepEqual(output, req._parsedUrl); //=> true\n```\n\n## API\n\n### url(req)\nReturns: `Object` or `undefined`\n\n> **Important:** The `req` must have a `url` key, otherwise `undefined` will be returned.<br>If no input is provided at all, a `TypeError` will be thrown.\n\n#### req\nType: `IncomingMessage` or `{ url: string }`\n\nThe incoming HTTP request (`req`) or a plain `Object` with a `url` key.\n\n> **Note:** In Node.js servers, the [`req.url`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_message_url) begins with a pathname & does not include a `hash`.\n\n\n## Benchmarks\n\nCheck out the [`bench`](/bench) directory for in-depth benchmark results and comparisons.\n\n\n## Support\n\nAny issues or questions can be sent to the [Polka][polka] repository.<br>However, please specify that your inquiry is about `@polka/url` specifically.\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT © [Luke Edwards](https://lukeed.com)\n\n[polka]: https://github.com/lukeed/polka",

By default no files are ignored.\n\n### `include`\n\nType: `String` | `Array[...String]`<br>\nDefault: `null`\n\nA [picomatch pattern](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch), or array of patterns, which specifies the files in the build the plugin should operate on. By default all files are targeted.\n\n## Meta\n\n[CONTRIBUTING](/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n[LICENSE (MIT)](/LICENSE)",

Use this plugin **before** any others such as node-resolve or commonjs, so they do not alter the output._\n\nSuppose an entry file containing the snippet below exists at `src/entry.js`, and attempts to load `batman` and `src/robin.js` from memory:\n\n```js\n// src/entry.js\nimport batman from 'batman';\nimport robin from './robin.js';\n\nconsole.log(batman, robin);\n```\n\nCreate a `rollup.config.js` [configuration file](https://www.rollupjs.org/guide/en/#configuration-files) and import the plugin:\n\n```js\nimport virtual from '@rollup/plugin-virtual';\n\nexport default {\n  input: 'src/entry.js',\n  // ...\n  plugins: [\n    virtual({\n      batman: `export default 'na na na na na'`,\n      'src/robin.js': `export default 'batmannnnn'`\n    })\n  ]\n};\n```\n\nThen call `rollup` either via the [CLI](https://www.rollupjs.org/guide/en/#command-line-reference) or the [API](https://www.rollupjs.org/guide/en/#javascript-api).\n\n## Options\n\nThis plugin has no formal options. The lone parameter for this plugin is an `Object` containing properties that correspond to a `String` containing the virtual module's code.\n\n## Using the Plugin for Bundle Input\n\nIt's possible to use the plugin to specify an entry point for a bundle. To do so, implement a pattern simple to what is shown below:\n\n```js\nimport virtual from '@rollup/plugin-virtual';\n\nexport default {\n  input: 'entry',\n  // ...\n  plugins: [\n    virtual({\n      entry: `\nimport batman from 'batcave';\nconsole.log(batman);\n`\n    })\n  ]\n};\n```\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE)",

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

It is used for building applications for Desktop Computers using a combination of Rust tools and HTML rendered in a Webview. Apps built with Tauri can ship with any number of pieces of an optional JS API / Rust API so that webviews can control the system via message passing. In fact, developers can extend the default API with their own functionality and bridge the Webview and Rust-based backend easily.\n\nTauri apps can have custom menus and have tray-type interfaces. They can be updated, and are managed by the user's operating system as expected. They are very small, because they use the system's webview. They do not ship a runtime, since the final binary is compiled from rust. This makes the reversing of Tauri apps not a trivial task.\n## This module\nWritten in Typescript and packaged such that it can be used with `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, and `bun`, this library provides a node.js runner for common tasks when using Tauri, like `yarn tauri dev`. For the most part it is a wrapper around [tauri-cli](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/tooling/cli).\n\nTo learn more about the details of how all of these pieces fit together, please consult this [ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/ARCHITECTURE.md) document.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nThe preferred method is to install this module locally as a development dependency:\n```\n$ npm install --save-dev @tauri-apps/cli\n$ yarn add --dev @tauri-apps/cli\n```\n\n## Semver\n**tauri** is following [Semantic Versioning 2.0](https://semver.org/).\n## Licenses\nCode: (c) 2019 - 2021 - The Tauri Programme within The Commons Conservancy.\n\nMIT or MIT/Apache 2.0 where applicable.\n\nLogo: CC-BY-NC-ND\n- Original Tauri Logo Designs by [Daniel Thompson-Yvetot](https://github.com/nothingismagick) and [Guillaume Chau](https://github.com/akryum)",

A python pip package to convert a TensorFlow SavedModel or TensorFlow Hub\nmodule to a web friendly format. If you already have a converted model, or are\nusing an already hosted model (e.g. MobileNet), skip this step.\n2. [JavaScript API](./src/executor/graph_model.ts), for loading and running\ninference.\n\n## Step 1: Converting a [TensorFlow SavedModel](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/saved_model/README.md), [TensorFlow Hub module](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/), [Keras HDF5](https://keras.io/getting_started/faq/#what-are-my-options-for-saving-models), [tf.keras SavedModel](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/saving/save_model), or [Flax/JAX model](http://github.com/google/flax) to a web-friendly format\n\n__0. Please make sure that you run in a Docker container or a virtual environment.__\n\n The script pulls its own subset of TensorFlow, which might conflict with the\n existing TensorFlow/Keras installation.\n\n__Note__: *Check that [`tf-nightly-cpu-2.0-preview`](https://pypi.org/project/tf-nightly-cpu-2.0-preview/#files) is available for your platform.*\n\nMost of the times, this means that you have to use Python 3.6.8 in your local\nenvironment. To force Python 3.6.8 in your local project, you can install\n[`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and proceed as follows in the target\ndirectory:\n\n```bash\npyenv install 3.6.8\npyenv local 3.6.8\n```\n\nNow, you can\n[create and activate](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)\na `venv` virtual environment in your current folder:\n\n```bash\nvirtualenv --no-site-packages venv\n. venv/bin/activate\n```\n\n__1. Install the TensorFlow.js pip package:__\n\nInstall the library with interactive CLI:\n```bash\n pip install tensorflowjs[wizard]\n```\n\n__2. Run the converter script provided by the pip package:__\n\nThere are three way to trigger the model conversion, explain below:\n\n- The conversion wizard: `tensorflowjs_wizard` ([go to section](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/blob/master/tfjs-converter/README.md#conversion-wizard-tensorflowjs_wizard))\n- Regular conversion script: `tensorflowjs_converter` ([go to section](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/tree/master/tfjs-converter#regular-conversion-script-tensorflowjs_converter))\n- Calling a converter function in Python (Flax/JAX) ([go to section](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/tree/master/tfjs-converter#calling-a-converter-function-in-python-flaxjax))\n\n## Conversion wizard: `tensorflowjs_wizard`\n\nTo start the conversion wizard:\n```bash\ntensorflowjs_wizard\n```\n\nThis tool will walk you through the conversion process and provide you with\ndetails explanations for each choice you need to make. Behind the scene it calls\nthe converter script (`tensorflowjs_converter`) in pip package. This is the\nrecommended way to convert a single model.\n\nThere is also a dry run mode for the wizard, which will not perform the actual\nconversion but only generate the command for `tensorflowjs_converter` command.\nThis generated command can be used in your own shell script.\n\nHere is an screen capture of the wizard in action. ![wizard](./tensorflowjs_wizard.gif)\n```bash\ntensorflowjs_wizard --dryrun\n```\n\nTo convert a batch of models or integrate the conversion process into your own\nscript, you should use the tensorflowjs_converter script.\n\n## Regular conversion script: `tensorflowjs_converter`\n\nThe converter expects a __TensorFlow SavedModel__, __TensorFlow Hub module__,\n__TensorFlow.js JSON__ format, __Keras HDF5 model__, or __tf.keras SavedModel__\nfor input.\n\n* __TensorFlow SavedModel__ example:\n\n```bash\ntensorflowjs_converter \\\n    --input_format=tf_saved_model \\\n    --output_format=tfjs_graph_model \\\n    --signature_name=serving_default \\\n    --saved_model_tags=serve \\\n    /mobilenet/saved_model \\\n    /mobilenet/web_model\n```\n* __TensorFlow Frozen Model__ example:\n\n__Note:__ Frozen model is a deprecated format and support is added for backward compatibility purpose.\n\n```bash\n$ tensorflowjs_converter \\\n    --input_format=tf_frozen_model \\\n    --output_node_names='MobilenetV1/Predictions/Reshape_1' \\\n    /mobilenet/frozen_model.pb \\\n    /mobilenet/web_model\n```\n\n* __Tensorflow Hub module__ example:\n\n```bash\ntensorflowjs_converter \\\n    --input_format=tf_hub \\\n    'https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v1_100_224/classification/1' \\\n    /mobilenet/web_model\n```\n\n* __Keras HDF5 model__ example:\n\n```bash\ntensorflowjs_converter \\\n    --input_format=keras \\\n    /tmp/my_keras_model.h5 \\\n    /tmp/my_tfjs_model\n```\n\n* __tf.keras SavedModel__ example:\n\n```bash\ntensorflowjs_converter \\\n    --input_format=keras_saved_model \\\n    /tmp/my_tf_keras_saved_model/1542211770 \\\n    /tmp/my_tfjs_model\n```\n\nNote that the input path used above is a subfolder that has a Unix epoch\ntime (1542211770) and is generated automatically by tensorflow when it\nsaved a tf.keras model in the SavedModel format.\n\n### Conversion Flags\n\n|Positional Arguments | Description |\n|---|---|\n|`input_path`  | Full path of the saved model directory or TensorFlow Hub module handle or path.|\n|`output_path` | Path for all output artifacts.|\n\n\n| Options | Description\n|---|---|\n|`--input_format`     | The format of input model, use `tf_saved_model` for SavedModel, `tf_hub` for TensorFlow Hub module, `tfjs_layers_model` for TensorFlow.js JSON format, and `keras` for Keras HDF5. |\n|`--output_format`| The desired output format.  Must be `tfjs_layers_model`, `tfjs_graph_model` or `keras`. Not all pairs of input-output formats are supported.  Please file a [github issue](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/issues) if your desired input-output pair is not supported.|\n|<nobr>`--saved_model_tags`</nobr> | Only applicable to SavedModel conversion. Tags of the MetaGraphDef to load, in comma separated format. If there are no tags defined in the saved model, set it to empty string `saved_model_tags=''`. Defaults to `serve`.|\n|`--signature_name`   | Only applicable to TensorFlow SavedModel and Hub module conversion, signature to load. Defaults to `serving_default` for SavedModel and `default` for Hub module. See https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/common_signatures/.|\n|`--strip_debug_ops`   | Strips out TensorFlow debug operations `Print`, `Assert`, `CheckNumerics`. Defaults to `True`.|\n|`--quantization_bytes`  | (Deprecated) How many bytes to optionally quantize/compress the weights to. Valid values are 1 and 2. which will quantize int32 and float32 to 1 or 2 bytes respectively. The default (unquantized) size is 4 bytes.|\n|`--quantize_float16`  | Comma separated list of node names to apply float16 quantization. You can also use wildcard symbol (\\*) to apply quantization to multiple nodes (e.g., conv/\\*/weights). When the flag is provided without any nodes the default behavior will match all nodes. |\n|`--quantize_uint8`  | Comma separated list of node names to apply 1-byte affine quantization. You can also use wildcard symbol (\\*) to apply quantization to multiple nodes (e.g., conv/\\*/weights). When the flag is provided without any nodes the default behavior will match all nodes. |\n|`--quantize_uint16`  | Comma separated list of node names to apply 2-byte affine quantization. You can also use wildcard symbol (\\*) to apply quantization to multiple nodes (e.g., conv/\\*/weights). When the flag is provided without any nodes the default behavior will match all nodes. |\n|`--weight_shard_size_bytes` | Shard size (in bytes) of the weight files. Only supported when `output_format` is `tfjs_layers_model` or `tfjs_graph_model`. Default size is 4 MB (4194304 bytes).|\n|<nobr>`--output_node_names`</nobr>| Only applicable to Frozen Model. The names of the output nodes, separated by commas.|\n|<nobr>`--control_flow_v2`</nobr>| Only applicable to TF 2.x Saved Model. This flag improve performance on models with control flow ops, default to False.|\n|<nobr>`--metadata`</nobr>| Comma separated list of metadata json file paths, indexed by name. Prefer absolute path. Example: 'metadata1:/metadata1.json,metadata2:/metadata2.json'.|\n|<nobr>`--use_structured_outputs_names`</nobr>| Changes output of graph model to match the structured_outputs format instead of list format. Defaults to `False`.|\n\n__Note: If you want to convert TensorFlow session bundle, you can install older versions of the tensorflowjs pip package, i.e. `pip install tensorflowjs==0.8.6`.__\n\n### Format Conversion Support Tables\n\nNote: Unless stated otherwise, we can infer the value of `--output_format` from the\nvalue of `--input_format`. So the `--output_format` flag can be omitted in\nmost cases.\n\n#### Python-to-JavaScript\n\n| `--input_format` | `--output_format` | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| `keras` | `tfjs_layers_model` | Convert a keras or tf.keras HDF5 model file to TensorFlow.js Layers model format. Use [`tf.loadLayersModel()`](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/#loadLayersModel) to load the model in JavaScript. The loaded model supports the full inference and training (e.g., transfer learning) features of the original keras or tf.keras model. |\n| `keras` | `tfjs_graph_model` | Convert a keras or tf.keras HDF5 model file to TensorFlow.js Graph model format. Use [`tf.loadGraphModel()`](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/#loadGraphModel) to load the converted model in JavaScript. The loaded model supports only inference, but the speed of inference is generally faster than that of a tfjs_layers_model (see above row) thanks to the graph optimization performed by TensorFlow. Another limitation of this conversion route is that it does not support some layer types (e.g., recurrent layers such as LSTM) yet. |\n| `keras_saved_model` | `tfjs_layers_model` | Convert a tf.keras SavedModel model file (from [`tf.contrib.saved_model.save_keras_model`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/saved_model/save_keras_model)) to TensorFlow.js Layers model format. Use [`tf.loadLayersModel()`](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/#loadLayersModel) to load the model in JavaScript. |\n| `tf_hub` | `tfjs_graph_model` | Convert a [TF-Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub) model file to TensorFlow.js graph model format. Use [`tf.loadGraphModel()`](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/#loadGraphModel) to load the converted model in JavaScript. |\n| `tf_saved_model` | `tfjs_graph_model` | Convert a [TensorFlow SavedModel](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model#build_and_load_a_savedmodel) to TensorFlow.js graph model format. Use [`tf.loadGraphModel()`](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/#loadGraphModel) to load the converted model in JavaScript. |\n| `tf_frozen_model` | `tfjs_graph_model` | Convert a [Frozen Model](https://medium.com/@sebastingarcaacosta/how-to-export-a-tensorflow-2-x-keras-model-to-a-frozen-and-optimized-graph-39740846d9eb) to TensorFlow.js graph model format. Use [`tf.loadGraphModel()`](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/#loadGraphModel) to load the converted model in JavaScript. |\n\n#### JavaScript-to-Python\n\n| `--input_format` | `--output_format` | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| `tfjs_layers_model` | `keras` | Convert a TensorFlow.js Layers model (JSON + binary weight file(s)) to a Keras HDF5 model file. Use [`keras.model.load_model()`](https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#savingloading-whole-models-architecture-weights-optimizer-state) or [`tf.keras.models.load_model()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/models/load_model) to load the converted model in Python. |\n| `tfjs_layers_model` | `keras_saved_model` | Convert a TensorFlow.js Layers model (JSON + binary weight file(s)) to the tf.keras SavedModel format. This format is useful for subsequent uses such as [TensorFlow Serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/serving/serving_basic) and [conversion to TFLite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/convert). |\n\n#### JavaScript-to-JavaScript\n\n##### Converting tfjs_layers_model to tfjs_layers_model with weight sharding and quantization\n\nThe tfjs_layers_model-to-tfjs_layer_model conversion option serves the following\npurposes:\n\n1. It allows you to shard the binary weight file into multiple small shards\n   to facilitate browser caching. This step is necessary for models with\n   large-sized weights saved from TensorFlow.js (either browser or Node.js),\n   because TensorFlow.js puts all weights in a single weight file\n   ('group1-shard1of1.bin'). To shard the weight file, do\n\n   ```sh\n   tensorflowjs_converter \\\n       --input_format tfjs_layers_model \\\n       --output_format tfjs_layers_model \\\n       original_model/model.json \\\n       sharded_model/\n   ```\n\n    The command above creates shards of size 4 MB (4194304 bytes) by default.\n    Alternative shard sizes can be specified using the\n    `--weight_shard_size_bytes` flag.\n\n2. It allows you to reduce the on-the-wire size of the weights through\n   16- or 8-bit quantization. For example:\n\n   ```sh\n   tensorflowjs_converter \\\n      --input_format tfjs_layers_model \\\n      --output_format tfjs_layers_model \\\n      --quantize_uint16 \\\n      original_model/model.json\n      quantized_model/\n   ```\n\n##### Converting tfjs_layers_model to tfjs_graph_model\n\nConverting a `tfjs_layers_model` to a `tfjs_graph_model` usually leads to\nfaster inference speed in the browser and Node.js, thanks to the graph\noptimization that goes into generating the tfjs_graph_models. For more details,\nsee the following document on TensorFlow's Grappler:\n[\"TensorFlow Graph Optimizations\" by R. Larsen an T. Shpeisman](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub48051).\n\nThere are two caveats:\n\n1. The model that results from this conversion does not support further\n   training.\n2. Certain layer types (e.g., recurrent layers such as LSTM) are not supported\n   yet.\n\nSee example command below:\n\n```sh\n tensorflowjs_converter \\\n    --input_format tfjs_layers_model \\\n    --output_format tfjs_graph_model \\\n    my_layers_model/model.json\n    my_graph_model/\n```\n\ntfjs_layers_model-to-tfjs_graph_model also support weight quantization.\n\n### Web-friendly format\n\nThe conversion script above produces 2 types of files:\n\n* `model.json` (the dataflow graph and weight manifest file)\n* `group1-shard\\*of\\*` (collection of binary weight files)\n\nFor example, here is the MobileNet model converted and served in\nfollowing location:\n\n```html\n  https://storage.cloud.google.com/tfjs-models/savedmodel/mobilenet_v1_1.0_224/model.json\n  https://storage.cloud.google.com/tfjs-models/savedmodel/mobilenet_v1_1.0_224/group1-shard1of5\n  ...\n  https://storage.cloud.google.com/tfjs-models/savedmodel/mobilenet_v1_1.0_224/group1-shard5of5\n```\n\n## Calling a Converter Function in Python (Flax/JAX)\n\nYou can also convert your model to web format in Python by calling one of the\nconversion functions. This is currently the only way to convert a Flax or JAX\nmodel, since no standard serialization format exists to store a Module (only the\ncheckpoints).\n\nHere we provide an example of how to convert a Flax function using the\nconversion function `tfjs.jax_conversion.convert_jax()`.\n\n```py\nimport numpy as np\nfrom flax import linen as nn\nfrom jax import random\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\nfrom tensorflowjs.converters import jax_conversion\n\nmodule = nn.Dense(features=4)\ninputs = jnp.ones((3, 4))\nparams = module.init(random.PRNKey(0), inputs)['params']\n\njax_conversion.convert_jax(\n  apply_fn=module.apply,\n  params=params,\n  input_signatures=[((3, 4), np.float32)],\n  model_dir=tfjs_model_dir)\n```\n\nNote that when using dynamic shapes, an additional argument `polymorphic_shapes`\nshould be provided specifying values for the dynamic (\"polymorphic\")\ndimensions). So in order to convert the same model as before, but now with a\ndynamic first dimension, one should call `convert_jax` as follows:\n\n```py\njax_conversion.convert_jax(\n  apply_fn=module.apply,\n  params=params,\n  input_signatures=[((None, 4), np.float32)],\n  polymorphic_shapes=[\"(b, 4)\"],\n  model_dir=tfjs_model_dir)\n```\n\nSee\n[here](https://github.com/google/jax/tree/main/jax/experimental/jax2tf#shape-polymorphic-conversion)\nfor more details on the exact syntax for this argument.\n\nWhen converting JAX models, you can also pass any [options that\n`convert_tf_saved_model`\nuses](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/blob/master/tfjs-converter/python/tensorflowjs/converters/tf_saved_model_conversion_v2.py#L951-L974).\nFor example, to quantize a model's weights, pass the `quantization_dtype_map`\noption listing the weights that should be quantized.\n\n```py\njax_conversion.convert_jax(\n  apply_fn=module.apply,\n  params=params,\n  input_signatures=[((3, 4), np.float32)],\n  model_dir=tfjs_model_dir,\n  quantization_dtype_map={'float16': '*'})\n```\n\n## Step 2: Loading and running in the browser\n\nIf the original model was a `SavedModel`, use\n[`tf.loadGraphModel()`](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/#loadGraphModel).\nIf it was Keras, use\n[`tf.loadLayersModel()`](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/#loadLayersModel):\n\n```typescript\nimport * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';\n\nconst MODEL_URL = 'https://.../mobilenet/model.json';\n\n// For Keras use tf.loadLayersModel().\nconst model = await tf.loadGraphModel(MODEL_URL);\nconst cat = document.getElementById('cat');\nmodel.predict(tf.browser.fromPixels(cat));\n```\n\nSee our API docs for the\n[`predict()`](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/#tf.GraphModel.predict)\nmethod. To see what other methods exist on a `Model`, see\n[`tf.LayersModel`](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/#class:LayersModel)\nand [`tf.GraphModel`](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/#class:GraphModel).\nAlso check out our working [MobileNet demo](./demo/mobilenet/README.md).\n\nIf your server requests credentials for accessing the model files, you can\nprovide the optional RequestOption param.\n\n```typescript\nconst model = await loadGraphModel(MODEL_URL,\n    {credentials: 'include'});\n```\n\nPlease see\n[fetch() documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch)\nfor details.\n\n### Native File System\n\nTensorFlow.js can be used from Node.js. See the\n[tfjs-node project](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-node) for more details.\nUnlike web browsers, Node.js can access the local file system directly.\nTherefore, you can load the same frozen model from local file system into\na Node.js program running TensorFlow.js. This is done by calling\n`loadGraphModel` with the path to the model files:\n\n```js\n// Load the tfjs-node binding\nimport * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs-node';\n\nconst MODEL_PATH = 'file:///tmp/mobilenet/model.json';\nconst model = await tf.loadGraphModel(MODEL_PATH);\n```\n\nYou can also load the remote model files the same way as in browser, but you\nmight need to polyfill\nthe fetch() method.\n\n## Supported operations\n\nCurrently TensorFlow.js only supports a limited set of TensorFlow Ops. See the\n[full list](./docs/supported_ops.md).\nIf your model uses unsupported ops, the `tensorflowjs_converter` script will\nfail and produce a list of the unsupported ops in your model. Please file issues\nto let us know what ops you need support with.\n\n## Manual forward pass and direct weights loading\n\nIf you want to manually write the forward pass with the ops API, you can load\nthe weights directly as a map from weight names to tensors:\n\n```js\nimport * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';\n\nconst modelUrl = \"https://example.org/model/model.json\";\n\nconst response = await fetch(modelUrl);\nthis.weightManifest = (await response.json())['weightsManifest'];\nconst weightMap = await tf.io.loadWeights(\n        this.weightManifest, \"https://example.org/model\");\n```\n\n`weightMap` maps a weight name to a tensor. You can use it to manually implement\nthe forward pass of the model:\n\n```js\nconst input = tf.tensor(...);\ntf.matMul(weightMap['fc1/weights'], input).add(weightMap['fc1/bias']);\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n__1. What TensorFlow models does the converter currently support?__\n\nImage-based models (MobileNet, SqueezeNet, add more if you tested) are the most\nsupported. Models with control flow ops (e.g. RNNs) are also supported.\nThe tensorflowjs_converter script will validate the model you have and show a\nlist of unsupported ops in your model. See [this list](./docs/supported_ops.md)\nfor which ops are currently supported.\n\n__2. Will model with large weights work?__\n\nWhile the browser supports loading 100-500MB models, the page load time,\nthe inference time and the user experience would not be great. We recommend\nusing models that are designed for edge devices (e.g. phones). These models are\nusually smaller than 30MB.\n\n__3. Will the model and weight files be cached in the browser?__\n\nYes, we are splitting the weights into files of 4MB chunks, which enable the\nbrowser to cache them automatically. If the model architecture is less than 4MB\n(most models are), it will also be cached.\n\n__4. Can I quantize the weights over the wire?__\n\nYes, you can use the --quantize_{float16, uint8, uint16} flags to compress\nweights with 1 byte integer quantization (`uint8`) or 2 byte integer\n(`uint16`)/float (`float16`) quantization.\nQuantizing to float16 may provide better accuracy over\n2 byte affine integer scaling (`uint16`). 1-byte affine quantization,\ni.e., `uint8` provides a 4x size reduction at the cost of accuracy.\nFor example, we can quantize our MobileNet model using float16 quantization:\n\n```\ntensorflowjs_converter\n    --quantize_float16 \\\n    --input_format=tf_hub \\\n    'https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v1_100_224/classification/1' \\\n    /mobilenet/web_model\n```\n\nYou can also quantize specific weights as well as weight groupings using\na wildcard replacement. For example,\n```\ntensorflowjs_converter\n    --quantize_float16=\"conv/*/weights\"\n```\nwhich will quantize all weights that match the pattern conv/*/weights.\nThis will exclude biases and any weights that don't begin with conv/.\nThis can be a powerful tool to reduce model size while trying to maximize\nperformance.\n\n__5. Why is the predict() method for inference so much slower on the first call than the subsequent calls?__\n\nThe time of first call also includes the compilation time of WebGL shader\nprograms for the model. After the first call the shader programs are cached,\nwhich makes the subsequent calls much faster. You can warm up the cache by\ncalling the predict method with an all zero inputs, right after the completion\nof the model loading.\n\n__6. I have a model converted with a previous version of TensorFlow.js converter (0.15.x), that is in .pb format. How do I convert it to the new JSON format?__\n\nYou can use the built-in migration tool to convert the models generated by\nprevious versions. Here are the steps:\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:tensorflow/tfjs-converter.git\ncd tfjs-converter\nyarn\nyarn ts-node tools/pb2json_converter.ts pb_model_directory/ json_model_directory/\n```\n\n`pb_model_directory` is the directory where the model generated by previous\nversion is located.\n`json_model_directory` is the destination directory for the converted model.\n\n\n## Development\n\nTo build **TensorFlow.js converter** from source, we need to prepare the dev environment and clone the project.\n\nBazel builds Python from source, so we install the dependencies required to build it. Since we will be using pip and C extensions, we also install the ssl, foreign functions, and zlib development packages. On debian, this is done with:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get build-dep python3\nsudo apt install libssl-dev libffi-dev zlib1g-dev\n```\n\nSee the [python developer guide](https://devguide.python.org/setup/#install-dependencies) for instructions on installing these for other platforms.\n\nThen, we clone the project and install dependencies with:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs.git\ncd tfjs\nyarn # Installs dependencies.\n```\n\nWe recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for\ndevelopment. Make sure to install\n[TSLint VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin)\nand the npm [clang-format](https://github.com/angular/clang-format) `1.2.2`\nor later with the\n[Clang-Format VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xaver.clang-format)\nfor auto-formatting.\n\nBefore submitting a pull request, make sure the code passes all the tests and is\nclean of lint errors:\n\n```bash\ncd tfjs-converter\nyarn test\nyarn lint\n```\n\nTo run a subset of tests and/or on a specific browser:\n\n```bash\nyarn test --browsers=Chrome --grep='execute'\n> ...\n> Chrome 64.0.3282 (Linux 0.0.0): Executed 39 of 39 SUCCESS (0.129 secs / 0 secs)\n```\n\nTo run the tests once and exit the karma process (helpful on Windows):\n\n```bash\nyarn test --single-run\n```\n\nTo run all the python tests\n\n```bash\nyarn run-python-tests\n```",

You can access TensorFlow.js Layers through the union package\n   between the TensorFlow.js Core and Layers:\n   [@tensorflow/tfjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow/tfjs)\n2.

As a standalone through [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/).\n\nOption 1 is the most convenient, but leads to a larger bundle size (we will be\nadding more packages to it in the future). Use option 2 if you care about bundle\nsize.\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Building, training and executing a model\n\nThe following example shows how to build a toy model with only one `dense` layer\nto perform linear regression.\n\n```js\nimport * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';\n\n// A sequential model is a container which you can add layers to.\nconst model = tf.sequential();\n\n// Add a dense layer with 1 output unit.\nmodel.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 1, inputShape: [1]}));\n\n// Specify the loss type and optimizer for training.\nmodel.compile({loss: 'meanSquaredError', optimizer: 'SGD'});\n\n// Generate some synthetic data for training.\nconst xs = tf.tensor2d([[1], [2], [3], [4]], [4, 1]);\nconst ys = tf.tensor2d([[1], [3], [5], [7]], [4, 1]);\n\n// Train the model.\nawait model.fit(xs, ys, {epochs: 500});\n\n// Ater the training, perform inference.\nconst output = model.predict(tf.tensor2d([[5]], [1, 1]));\noutput.print();\n```\n\n### Loading a pretrained Keras model\n\nYou can also load a model previously trained and saved from elsewhere (e.g.,\nfrom Python Keras) and use it for inference or transfer learning in the browser.\n\nFor example, in Python, save your Keras model using\n[tensorflowjs](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflowjs/),\nwhich can be installed using `pip install tensorflowjs`.\n\n\n```python\nimport tensorflowjs as tfjs\n\n# ... Create and train your Keras model.\n\n# Save your Keras model in TensorFlow.js format.\ntfjs.converters.save_keras_model(model, '/path/to/tfjs_artifacts/')\n\n# Then use your favorite web server to serve the directory at a URL, say\n#   http://foo.bar/tfjs_artifacts/model.json\n```\n\nTo load the model with TensorFlow.js Layers:\n\n```js\nimport * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';\n\nconst model = await tf.loadLayersModel('http://foo.bar/tfjs_artifacts/model.json');\n// Now the model is ready for inference, evaluation or re-training.\n```\n\n## For more information\n\n- [TensorFlow.js API documentation](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/)\n- [TensorFlow.js Tutorials](https://js.tensorflow.org/tutorials/)",

Use this webpage tool to collect the performance related metrics (speed, memory, etc) of TensorFlow.js models and kernels **on your local device** with CPU, WebGL or WASM backends. You can benchmark custom models by following this [guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/blob/master/e2e/benchmarks/local-benchmark/README.md).\n* [Multi-device benchmark tool](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/tree/master/e2e/benchmarks/browserstack-benchmark/README.md). Use this tool to collect the same performance related metrics **on a collection of remote devices**.\n\n## Getting started\n\nThere are two main ways to get TensorFlow.js in your JavaScript project:\nvia <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_JavaScript_within_a_webpage\" target=\"_blank\">script tags</a> <strong>or</strong> by installing it from <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">NPM</a>\nand using a build tool like <a href=\"https://parceljs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Parcel</a>,\n<a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WebPack</a>, or <a href=\"https://rollupjs.org/guide/en\" target=\"_blank\">Rollup</a>.\n\n### via Script Tag\n\nAdd the following code to an HTML file:\n\n```html\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <!-- Load TensorFlow.js -->\n    <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs/dist/tf.min.js\"> </script>\n\n\n    <!-- Place your code in the script tag below. You can also use an external .js file -->\n    <script>\n      // Notice there is no 'import' statement. 'tf' is available on the index-page\n      // because of the script tag above.\n\n      // Define a model for linear regression.\n      const model = tf.sequential();\n      model.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 1, inputShape: [1]}));\n\n      // Prepare the model for training: Specify the loss and the optimizer.\n      model.compile({loss: 'meanSquaredError', optimizer: 'sgd'});\n\n      // Generate some synthetic data for training.\n      const xs = tf.tensor2d([1, 2, 3, 4], [4, 1]);\n      const ys = tf.tensor2d([1, 3, 5, 7], [4, 1]);\n\n      // Train the model using the data.\n      model.fit(xs, ys).then(() => {\n        // Use the model to do inference on a data point the model hasn't seen before:\n        // Open the browser devtools to see the output\n        model.predict(tf.tensor2d([5], [1, 1])).print();\n      });\n    </script>\n  </head>\n\n  <body>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nOpen up that HTML file in your browser, and the code should run!\n\n### via NPM\n\nAdd TensorFlow.js to your project using <a href=\"https://yarnpkg.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\">yarn</a> <em>or</em> <a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm\" target=\"_blank\">npm</a>. <b>Note:</b> Because\nwe use ES2017 syntax (such as `import`), this workflow assumes you are using a modern browser or a bundler/transpiler\nto convert your code to something older browsers understand. See our\n<a href='https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples' target=\"_blank\">examples</a>\nto see how we use <a href=\"https://parceljs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Parcel</a> to build\nour code. However, you are free to use any build tool that you prefer.\n\n\n\n```js\nimport * as tf from '@tensorflow/tfjs';\n\n// Define a model for linear regression.\nconst model = tf.sequential();\nmodel.add(tf.layers.dense({units: 1, inputShape: [1]}));\n\n// Prepare the model for training: Specify the loss and the optimizer.\nmodel.compile({loss: 'meanSquaredError', optimizer: 'sgd'});\n\n// Generate some synthetic data for training.\nconst xs = tf.tensor2d([1, 2, 3, 4], [4, 1]);\nconst ys = tf.tensor2d([1, 3, 5, 7], [4, 1]);\n\n// Train the model using the data.\nmodel.fit(xs, ys).then(() => {\n  // Use the model to do inference on a data point the model hasn't seen before:\n  model.predict(tf.tensor2d([5], [1, 1])).print();\n});\n```\n\nSee our <a href=\"https://js.tensorflow.org/tutorials/\" target=\"_blank\">tutorials</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples\" target=\"_blank\">examples</a>\nand <a href=\"https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/\">documentation</a> for more details.\n\n## Importing pre-trained models\n\nWe support porting pre-trained models from:\n- [TensorFlow SavedModel](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/tutorials/conversion/import_saved_model)\n- [Keras](https://js.tensorflow.org/tutorials/import-keras.html)\n\n## Various ops supported in different backends\n\nPlease refer below :\n- [TFJS Ops Matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D25XtWaBrmUEErbGQB0QmNhH-xtwHo9LDl59w0TbxrI/edit#gid=0)\n\n## Find out more\n\n[TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org) is a part of the\n[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) ecosystem. For more info:\n- For help from the community, use the `tfjs` tag on the [TensorFlow Forum](https://discuss.tensorflow.org/tag/tfjs).\n- [TensorFlow.js Website](https://js.tensorflow.org)\n- [Tutorials](https://js.tensorflow.org/tutorials)\n- [API reference](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/)\n- [TensorFlow.js Blog](https://blog.tensorflow.org/search?label=TensorFlow.js)\n\nThanks, <a href=\"https://www.browserstack.com/\">BrowserStack</a>, for providing testing support.",

These owners may contribute\nto the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further\nproduction of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or\ngreater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of\nothers.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of\nadditional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and\npublicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\n   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and\n   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\n   to, the following:\n   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n      and translate a Work;\n   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness\n      depicted in a Work;\n   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;\n   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n      a Work;\n   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\n      thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\n   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\n   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright\n   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\n   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\n   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\n   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer\n   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and\n   to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that\n   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\n   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet\n   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express\n   Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\n   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\n   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\n   Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the\n   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a\n   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\n   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and\n   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\n   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License\n   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\n   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\n   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\n   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in\n   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any\n   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)\n   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,\n   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\n      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or\n      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,\n      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or\n      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or\n      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest\n      extent permissible under applicable law.\n   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n      limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this\n      CC0 or use of the Work.\n\nFor more information, please see\nhttp://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/.",

The translations are loaded into the main process by VS Code itself.\n\n## Usage\n\n```typescript\nimport * as l10n from '@vscode/l10n';\n\n// Load the translations for the current locale\nl10n.config({\n    contents: JSON.parse(process.env.BUNDLE_FROM_EXTENSION)\n});\n// or\nl10n.config({\n    fsPath: process.env.FSPATH_TO_BUNDLE_FROM_EXTENSION\n});\n// or (warning, this is async)\nawait l10n.config({\n    uri: JSON.parse(process.env.BUNDLE_URI_FROM_EXTENSION)\n});\n\n// returns the translated string or the original string if no translation is available\nl10n.t('Hello World');\n\n// supports arguments just like the vscode API\nl10n.t('Hello {0}', 'John');\n\n// supports comments for translators\nl10n.t({\n    message: 'Hello {0}',\n    args: ['John'],\n    comment: ['This is a comment']\n});\n```\n\nThe input for `l10n.config` pairs nicely with the `bundle` and `uri` properties on the `l10n` namespace that are provided by the [VS Code API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#l10n).\nYou should send the value of one of these properties from your extension to your subprocess that is consuming `@vscode/l10n`.",

    "licenseText": "agent-base\n==========\n### Turn a function into an [`http.Agent`][http.Agent] instance\n[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base/actions?workflow=Node+CI)\n\nThis module provides an `http.Agent` generator. That is, you pass it an async\ncallback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the\ngiven callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.\n\n#### Some subclasses:\n\nHere's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.\nSend a pull request to list yours!\n\n * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints\n * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints\n * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS\n * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install agent-base\n```\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\nHere's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server\nfor every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):\n\n```js\nvar net = require('net');\nvar tls = require('tls');\nvar url = require('url');\nvar http = require('http');\nvar agent = require('agent-base');\n\nvar endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/';\nvar parsed = url.parse(endpoint);\n\n// This is the important part!\nparsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {\n  var socket;\n  // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module\n  if (opts.secureEndpoint) {\n    socket = tls.connect(opts);\n  } else {\n    socket = net.connect(opts);\n  }\n  return socket;\n});\n\n// Everything else works just like normal...\nhttp.get(parsed, function (res) {\n  console.log('\"response\" event!', res.headers);\n  res.pipe(process.stdout);\n});\n```\n\nReturning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:\n\n```js\nagent(async function (req, opts) {\n  await sleep(1000);\n  // etc…\n});\n```\n\nReturn another `http.Agent` instance to \"pass through\" the responsibility\nfor that HTTP request to that agent:\n\n```js\nagent(function (req, opts) {\n  return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent;\n});\n```\n\n\nAPI\n---\n\n## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) → [http.Agent][]\n\nCreates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback`\nfor every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function\nis responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be\nused as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.\n\nThe `options` object accepts the following properties:\n\n  * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).\n\nThe callback function should have the following signature:\n\n### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) → undefined\n\nThe ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and\nand the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed\nto the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted\nto be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however\nelse you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to\nthe callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will\ncontinue to proceed.\n\nIf the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the\n`secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[http-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-http-proxy-agent\n[https-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent\n[pac-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-pac-proxy-agent\n[socks-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent\n[http.Agent]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent",

These owners may contribute\nto the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further\nproduction of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or\ngreater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of\nothers.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of\nadditional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and\npublicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\n   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and\n   Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\n   to, the following:\n   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n      and translate a Work;\n   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness\n      depicted in a Work;\n   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;\n   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n      a Work;\n   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\n      thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\n   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\n   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright\n   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\n   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\n   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\n   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer\n   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and\n   to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that\n   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\n   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet\n   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express\n   Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\n   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\n   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\n   Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the\n   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a\n   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\n   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and\n   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\n   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License\n   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\n   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\n   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\n   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in\n   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any\n   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)\n   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,\n   in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,\n      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties\n      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or\n      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,\n      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or\n      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or\n      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest\n      extent permissible under applicable law.\n   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\n      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\n      limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\n      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\n      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\n      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this\n      CC0 or use of the Work.\n\nFor more information, please see\nhttp://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/.",

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Eg. [`CSSselect`](https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.\n\n###And why is this a separate module?\n\nI'm trying to modularize `CSSselect` and most modules depend on these functions.

The\nfollowing considerations are for informational purposes only, are not\nexhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\n     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are\n     intended for use by those authorized to give the public\n     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by\n     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are\n     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms\n     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\n     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\n     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any\n     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-\n     licensed material, or material used under an exception or\n     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:\n\twiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\n\n     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public\n     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the\n     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If\n     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\n     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\n     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\n     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\n     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\n     respect those requests where reasonable.

To the\nextent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are\ngranted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of\nthese terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in\nconsideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the\nLicensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n\nSection 1 -- Definitions.\n\n  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar\n     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material\n     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,\n     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring\n     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the\n     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright\n     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in\n     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights\n     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,\n     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or\n     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights\n     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar\n     Rights.\n\n  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n     agreements.\n\n  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n     License.\n\n  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\n     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\n     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\n     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\n  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n     under this Public License.\n\n  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\n     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\n     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\n     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\n     available to the public including in ways that members of the\n     public may access the material from a place and at a time\n     individually chosen by them.\n\n  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright\n     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of\n     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,\n     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially\n     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n\n  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\n     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n\nSection 2 -- Scope.\n\n  a. License grant.\n\n       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n               in part; and\n\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Effective Date\n\n     The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become\n     effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes\n     such Contribution.\n\n2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\n\n     The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this\n     License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution\n     or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section\n     2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:\n\n     a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or\n\n     b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s\n        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n        Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n        Version); or\n\n     c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its\n        Contributions.\n\n     This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or\n     logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the\n     notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n\n2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n\n     No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\n     distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License\n     (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted\n     under the terms of Section 3.3).\n\n2.5. Representation\n\n     Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions\n     are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the\n     rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n\n2.6. Fair Use\n\n     This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable\n     copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.\n\n2.7. Conditions\n\n     Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in\n     Section 2.1.\n\n\n3. Responsibilities\n\n3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n\n     All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\n     Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the\n     terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form\n     of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how\n     they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or\n     restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\n     If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n     a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,\n        as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the\n        Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by\n        reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost\n        of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n     b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,\n        or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for\n        the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’\n        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\n     You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n     provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the\n     Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software\n     with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered\n     Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits\n     You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of\n     such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at\n     their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of\n     either this License or such Secondary License(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\n     You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including\n     copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\n     of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered\n     Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent\n     required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n\n     You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n     indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\n     Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf\n     of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such\n     warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You\n     alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\n     liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n     indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\n     disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\n     jurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n\n   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License\n   with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial\n   order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License\n   to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code\n   they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all\n   distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the\n   extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\n   sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\n   understand it.\n\n5. Termination\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You\n     fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,\n     then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor\n     are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor\n     explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,\n     if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some\n     reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.\n     Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an\n     ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by\n     some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of\n     non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become\n     compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n     infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,\n     and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or\n     indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and\n     all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License\n     shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user\n     license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been\n     validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to\n     termination shall survive termination.\n\n6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n\n   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without\n   warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,\n   without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,\n   merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire\n   risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.\n   Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any\n   Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or\n   correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this\n   License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License\n   except under this disclaimer.\n\n7. Limitation of Liability\n\n   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including\n   negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who\n   distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any\n   direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any\n   character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of\n   goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n   other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been\n   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability\n   shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such\n   party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.\n   Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or\n   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.\n\n8. Litigation\n\n   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of\n   a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business\n   and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without\n   reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall\n   prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\n\n9. Miscellaneous\n\n   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter\n   hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such\n   provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\n   enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a\n   contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe\n   this License against a Contributor.\n\n\n10. Versions of the License\n\n10.1. New Versions\n\n      Mozilla Foundation is the license steward.

The `.stack` and `.message` properties will be carried over from the original error and `.code` or any passed properties will be set on it.\n\n\n## Tests\n\n`$ npm test`\n\n\n## License\n\nReleased under the [MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).",

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).\n\n```javascript\nesrecurse.visit(\n    ast,\n    {\n        Literal: function (node) {\n            // do something...\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        fallback: 'iteration'\n    }\n);\n```\n\nIf the `fallback` option is a function, `esrecurse` calls this function to determine the enumerable properties of unknown nodes.\nPlease note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).\n\n```javascript\nesrecurse.visit(\n    ast,\n    {\n        Literal: function (node) {\n            // do something...\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        fallback: function (node) {\n            return Object.keys(node).filter(function(key) {\n                return key !== 'argument'\n            });\n        }\n    }\n);\n```\n\n### License\n\nCopyright (C) 2014 [Yusuke Suzuki](https://github.com/Constellation)\n (twitter: [@Constellation](https://twitter.com/Constellation)) and other contributors.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n  * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n    documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nARE DISCLAIMED.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Read the [Upgrade Guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/modular-upgrade) to learn more.\n\n## Overview\n\n[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) provides the tools and infrastructure\nyou need to develop, grow, and earn money from your app. This package supports\nweb (browser), mobile-web, and server (Node.js) clients.\n\nFor more information, visit:\n\n- [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/start) -\n  The Firebase Realtime Database lets you store and query user data, and makes\n  it available between users in realtime.\n- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) -\n  Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server\n  development from Firebase and Google Cloud Platform.\n- [Firebase Storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/web/start) -\n  Firebase Storage lets you upload and store user generated content, such as\n  files, and images.\n- [Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions) -\n   Cloud Functions for Firebase is a serverless framework that lets you automatically run backend code in response to events triggered by Firebase features and HTTPS requests.\n- [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/js/client) -\n  Firebase Cloud Messaging is a cross-platform messaging solution that lets you\n  reliably deliver messages at no cost.\n- [Firebase Performance Monitoring](https://firebase.google.com/docs/perf-mon/get-started-web) -\n  Firebase Performance Monitoring helps you gain insight into your app's performance issues.\n- [Google Analytics](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/get-started?platform=web) -\n  Google Analytics is a free app measurement solution that provides insight on app usage and user engagement.\n- [Remote Config](https://firebase.google.com/docs/remote-config/get-started?platform=web) -\n  Firebase Remote Config is a cloud service that lets you change the behavior and appearance of your \n  app without requiring users to reload your app.\n- [App Check](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-check/web/recaptcha-provider) -\n  App Check helps protect your backend resources from abuse, such as billing fraud and phishing. It \n  works with both Firebase services and your own backends to keep your resources safe.\n- [Create and setup your account](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup) -\n  Get started using Firebase for free.\n\nThis SDK is intended for end-user client access from environments such as the\nWeb, mobile Web (e.g. React Native, Ionic), Node.js desktop (e.g. Electron), or\nIoT devices running Node.js. If you are instead interested in using a Node.js\nSDK which grants you admin access from a privileged environment (like a server),\nyou should use the\n[Firebase Admin Node.js SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup/).\n\n### Install the SDK\n\nInstall the Firebase NPM module:\n```\n$ npm init\n$ npm install --save firebase\n```\n\n### Use Firebase in your app\n\n1. Initialize Firebase in your app and create a Firebase App object:\n```js\nimport { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';\n\n// TODO: Replace the following with your app's Firebase project configuration\nconst firebaseConfig = {\n  //...\n};\n\nconst app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);\n```\n\n2. Access Firebase services in your app\n\nFirebase services (like Cloud Firestore, Authentication, Realtime Database, Remote Config, and more) are available to import within individual sub-packages.\n\nThe example below shows how you could use the Cloud Firestore Lite SDK to retrieve a list of data.\n\n```js\nimport { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';\nimport { getFirestore, collection, getDocs } from 'firebase/firestore/lite';\n// Follow this pattern to import other Firebase services\n// import { } from 'firebase/<service>';\n\n// TODO: Replace the following with your app's Firebase project configuration\nconst firebaseConfig = {\n  //...\n};\n\nconst app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);\nconst db = getFirestore(app);\n\n// Get a list of cities from your database\nasync function getCities(db) {\n  const citiesCol = collection(db, 'cities');\n  const citySnapshot = await getDocs(citiesCol);\n  const cityList = citySnapshot.docs.map(doc => doc.data());\n  return cityList;\n}\n```\n\n### Use a module bundler for size reduction\n\nThe Firebase Web SDK is designed to work with module bundlers to remove any\nunused code (tree-shaking). We strongly recommend using this approach for\nproduction apps. Tools such as the [Angular CLI](//angular.io/cli),\n[Next.js](//nextjs.org/), [Vue CLI](//cli.vuejs.org/), or [Create\nReact App](//reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) automatically\nhandle module bundling for libraries installed through npm and imported into\nyour codebase.\n\nSee [Using module bundlers with Firebase](/docs/web/module-bundling) for more information.\n\n### Script include\nYou can also load Firebase packages as script modules in browsers that support native ES modules.\n\n```html\n<!-- use script module by specifying type=\"module\" -->\n<script type=\"module\">\n    import { initializeApp } from 'https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-app.js';\n    import { getFirestore, collection, getDocs } from 'https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-firestore-lite.js';\n    // Follow this pattern to import other Firebase services\n    // import {} from \"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-analytics.js\";\n    // import {} from \"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-app-check.js\";\n    // import {} from \"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-auth.js\";\n    // import {} from \"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-functions.js\";\n    // import {} from \"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-firestore.js\";\n    // import {} from \"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-storage.js\";\n    // import {} from \"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-performance.js\";\n    // import {} from \"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-remote-config.js\";\n    // import {} from \"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-messaging.js\";\n    // import {} from \"https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/${FIREBASE_VERSION}/firebase-database.js\";\n    \n    // TODO: Replace the following with your app's Firebase project configuration\n    const firebaseConfig = {\n    //...\n    };\n\n    const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);\n    const db = getFirestore(app);\n\n    // Get a list of cities from your database\n    async function getCities(db) {\n    const citiesCol = collection(db, 'cities');\n    const citySnapshot = await getDocs(citiesCol);\n    const cityList = citySnapshot.docs.map(doc => doc.data());\n    return cityList;\n    }\n</script>\n```\n\n_Note: To get a filled in version of the above code snippet, go to the\n[Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) for your app and click on \"Add\nFirebase to your web app\"._\n\n## Get the code (Node.js - server and command line)\n\n### Install the SDK\n\nWhile you can write entire Firebase applications without any backend code, many\ndevelopers want to write server applications or command-line utilities using the\nNode.js JavaScript runtime.\n\nYou can use the same npm module to use Firebase in the Node.js runtime (on a\nserver or running from the command line):\n\n```\n$ npm init\n$ npm install --save firebase\n```\n\nIn your code, you can access Firebase using:\n\n```js\nconst { initializeApp } = require('firebase/app');\nconst { getFirestore, collection, getDocs } = require('firebase/firestore');\n// ...\n```\n\nIf you are using native ES6 module with --experimental-modules flag (or Node 12+)\nyou should do:\n\n```js\nimport { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';\nimport { getFirestore, collection, getDocs } from 'firebase/firestore';\n// ...\n```\n\nPlease see [Environment Support](https://firebase.google.com/support/guides/environments_js-sdk) for which packages\nare available in Node.js.\n\n## Compat packages\nVersion 9 provides a set of compat packages that are API compatible with Version 8. They are intended to\nbe used to make the upgrade to the modular API easier by allowing you to upgrade your app piece by piece.\nSee the [Upgrade Guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/modular-upgrade) for more detail.\n\nTo access the compat packages, use the subpath `compat` like so:\n```js\n// v9 compat packages are API compatible with v8 code\nimport firebase from 'firebase/compat/app';\nimport 'firebase/compat/auth';\nimport 'firebase/compat/firestore';\n```\n\n## Changelog\n\nThe Firebase changelog can be found at\n[firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com/support/release-notes/js).\n\n## Browser/environment compatibility\n\nPlease see [Environment Support](https://firebase.google.com/support/guides/environments_js-sdk).",

    "licenseText": "https-proxy-agent\n================\n### An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS\n[![Build Status](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent/actions?workflow=Node+CI)\n\nThis module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified\nHTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `https` module.\n\nSpecifically, this `Agent` implementation connects to an intermediary \"proxy\"\nserver and issues the [CONNECT HTTP method][CONNECT], which tells the proxy to\nopen a direct TCP connection to the destination server.\n\nSince this agent implements the CONNECT HTTP method, it also works with other\nprotocols that use this method when connecting over proxies (i.e. WebSockets).\nSee the \"Examples\" section below for more.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install https-proxy-agent\n```\n\n\nExamples\n--------\n\n#### `https` module example\n\n``` js\nvar url = require('url');\nvar https = require('https');\nvar HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');\n\n// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to\nvar proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';\nconsole.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);\n\n// HTTPS endpoint for the proxy to connect to\nvar endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://graph.facebook.com/tootallnate';\nconsole.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);\nvar options = url.parse(endpoint);\n\n// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information\nvar agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(proxy);\noptions.agent = agent;\n\nhttps.get(options, function (res) {\n  console.log('\"response\" event!', res.headers);\n  res.pipe(process.stdout);\n});\n```\n\n#### `ws` WebSocket connection example\n\n``` js\nvar url = require('url');\nvar WebSocket = require('ws');\nvar HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');\n\n// HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to\nvar proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';\nconsole.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);\n\n// WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to\nvar endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org';\nvar parsed = url.parse(endpoint);\nconsole.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);\n\n// create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information\nvar options = url.parse(proxy);\n\nvar agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(options);\n\n// finally, initiate the WebSocket connection\nvar socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });\n\nsocket.on('open', function () {\n  console.log('\"open\" event!');\n  socket.send('hello world');\n});\n\nsocket.on('message', function (data, flags) {\n  console.log('\"message\" event! %j %j', data, flags);\n  socket.close();\n});\n```\n\nAPI\n---\n\n### new HttpsProxyAgent(Object options)\n\nThe `HttpsProxyAgent` class implements an `http.Agent` subclass that connects\nto the specified \"HTTP(s) proxy server\" in order to proxy HTTPS and/or WebSocket\nrequests. This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].\n\nThe `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an\n\"options\" object with more specific properties:\n\n  * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.\n  * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.\n  * `protocol` - String - If `https:`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy.\n  * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.\n  * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[CONNECT]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel#HTTP_CONNECT_Tunneling",

    "description": "An incremental implementation of MurmurHash3",
    "copyright": "",
    "licenseText": "iMurmurHash.js\n==============\n\nAn incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).\n\nThis version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3\n</script>\n```\n\n---\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:\n\n```bash\nnpm install imurmurhash\n```\n\nThen simply include it in your scripts:\n\n```javascript\nMurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');\n```\n\nQuick Example\n-------------\n\n```javascript\n// Create the initial hash\nvar hashState = MurmurHash3('string');\n\n// Incrementally add text\nhashState.hash('more strings');\nhashState.hash('even more strings');\n\n// All calls can be chained if desired\nhashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');\n\n// Get a result\nhashState.result();\n// returns 0xe4ccfe6b\n```\n\nFunctions\n---------\n\n### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])\nGet a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:\n\n```javascript\n// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same\n// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)\nhashState = MurmurHash3();\n...\n\n// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the\n// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss\n// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.\nhashState = new MurmurHash3();\n```\n\nBoth methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)\nIncrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()\nGet the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.\n\n```javascript\n// Do the whole string at once\nMurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();\n// 0x70529328\n\n// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part\nvar m = MurmurHash3('this is a');\nm.result();\n// 0xbfc4f834\nm.hash(' test string').result();\n// 0x70529328 (same as above)\n```\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])\nReset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\nLicense (MIT)\n-------------\nCopyright (c) 2013 Gary Court, Jens Taylor\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

If you're searching for a full blown command line program utility, then check out [Commander.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander.js) or [Vorpal.js](https://github.com/dthree/vorpal).\n\n\n## Documentation\n\n### Installation\n\n``` shell\nnpm install inquirer\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar inquirer = require(\"inquirer\");\ninquirer.prompt([/* Pass your questions in here */], function( answers ) {\n\t// Use user feedback for... whatever!!\n});\n```\n\n\n### Examples (Run it and see it)\nCheckout the `examples/` folder for code and interface examples.\n\n``` shell\nnode examples/pizza.js\nnode examples/checkbox.js\n# etc...\n```\n\n\n### Methods\n\n`inquirer.prompt( questions, callback )`\n\nLaunch the prompt interface (inquiry session)\n\n- **questions** (Array) containing [Question Object](#question) (using the [reactive interface](#reactive-interface), you can also pass a `Rx.Observable` instance)\n- **callback** (Function) first parameter is the [Answers Object](#answers)\n\n\n### Objects\n\n#### Question\nA question object is a `hash` containing question related values:\n\n- **type**: (String) Type of the prompt. Defaults: `input` - Possible values: `input`, `confirm`,\n`list`, `rawlist`, `password`\n- **name**: (String) The name to use when storing the answer in the answers hash.\n- **message**: (String|Function) The question to print. If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.\n- **default**: (String|Number|Array|Function) Default value(s) to use if nothing is entered, or a function that returns the default value(s). If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.\n- **choices**: (Array|Function) Choices array or a function returning a choices array. If defined as a function, the first parameter will be the current inquirer session answers.\nArray values can be simple `strings`, or `objects` containing a `name` (to display in list), a `value` (to save in the answers hash) and a `short` (to display after selection) properties. The choices array can also contain [a `Separator`](#separator).\n- **validate**: (Function) Receive the user input and should return `true` if the value is valid, and an error message (`String`) otherwise. If `false` is returned, a default error message is provided.\n- **filter**: (Function) Receive the user input and return the filtered value to be used inside the program. The value returned will be added to the _Answers_ hash.\n- **when**: (Function, Boolean) Receive the current user answers hash and should return `true` or `false` depending on whether or not this question should be asked. The value can also be a simple boolean.\n\n`default`, `choices`(if defined as functions), `validate`, `filter` and `when` functions can be called asynchronously using `this.async()`. You just have to pass the value you'd normally return to the callback option.\n\n``` javascript\n{\n  validate: function(input) {\n\n    // Declare function as asynchronous, and save the done callback\n    var done = this.async();\n\n    // Do async stuff\n    setTimeout(function() {\n      if (typeof input !== \"number\") {\n        // Pass the return value in the done callback\n        done(\"You need to provide a number\");\n        return;\n      }\n      // Pass the return value in the done callback\n      done(true);\n    }, 3000);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Answers\nA key/value hash containing the client answers in each prompt.\n\n- **Key** The `name` property of the _question_ object\n- **Value** (Depends on the prompt)\n  - `confirm`: (Boolean)\n  - `input` : User input (filtered if `filter` is defined) (String)\n  - `rawlist`, `list` : Selected choice value (or name if no value specified) (String)\n\n### Separator\nA separator can be added to any `choices` array:\n\n```\n// In the question object\nchoices: [ \"Choice A\", new inquirer.Separator(), \"choice B\" ]\n\n// Which'll be displayed this way\n[?] What do you want to do?\n > Order a pizza\n   Make a reservation\n   --------\n   Ask opening hours\n   Talk to the receptionist\n```\n\nThe constructor takes a facultative `String` value that'll be use as the separator. If omitted, the separator will be `--------`.\n\nSeparator instances have a property `type` equal to `separator`. This should allow tools façading Inquirer interface from detecting separator types in lists.\n\nPrompts type\n---------------------\n\n> **Note:**: _allowed options written inside square brackets (`[]`) are optional. Others are required._\n\n#### List - `{ type: \"list\" }`\n\nTake `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`, `filter`] properties. (Note that\ndefault must be the choice `index` in the array or a choice `value`)\n\n![List prompt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/list-prompt.png)\n\n---\n\n#### Raw List - `{ type: \"rawlist\" }`\n\nTake `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`, `filter`] properties. (Note that\ndefault must the choice `index` in the array)\n\n![Raw list prompt](https://i.cloudup.com/LcRGpXI0CX-3000x3000.png)\n\n---\n\n#### Expand - `{ type: \"expand\" }`\n\nTake `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `default`, `filter`] properties. (Note that\ndefault must be the choice `index` in the array)\n\nNote that the `choices` object will take an extra parameter called `key` for the `expand` prompt. This parameter must be a single (lowercased) character. The `h` option is added by the prompt and shouldn't be defined by the user.\n\nSee `examples/expand.js` for a running example.\n\n![Expand prompt closed](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/expand-prompt-1.png)\n![Expand prompt expanded](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/expand-prompt-2.png)\n\n---\n\n#### Checkbox - `{ type: \"checkbox\" }`\n\nTake `type`, `name`, `message`, `choices`[, `filter`, `validate`, `default`] properties. `default` is expected to be an Array of the checked choices value.\n\nChoices marked as `{ checked: true }` will be checked by default.\n\nChoices whose property `disabled` is truthy will be unselectable. If `disabled` is a string, then the string will be outputted next to the disabled choice, otherwise it'll default to `\"Disabled\"`. The `disabled` property can also be a synchronous function receiving the current answers as argument and returning a boolean or a string.\n\n![Checkbox prompt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/checkbox-prompt.png)\n\n---\n\n#### Confirm - `{ type: \"confirm\" }`\n\nTake `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`] properties. `default` is expected to be a boolean if used.\n\n![Confirm prompt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/confirm-prompt.png)\n\n---\n\n#### Input - `{ type: \"input\" }`\n\nTake `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`] properties.\n\n![Input prompt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/input-prompt.png)\n\n---\n\n#### Password - `{ type: \"password\" }`\n\nTake `type`, `name`, `message`[, `default`, `filter`, `validate`] properties.\n\n![Password prompt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59696254/inquirer/password-prompt.png)\n\n## User Interfaces and layouts\n\nAlong with the prompts, Inquirer offers some basic text UI.\n\n#### Bottom Bar - `inquirer.ui.BottomBar`\n\nThis UI present a fixed text at the bottom of a free text zone. This is useful to keep a message to the bottom of the screen while outputting command outputs on the higher section.\n\n```javascript\nvar ui = new inquirer.ui.BottomBar();\n\n// pipe a Stream to the log zone\noutputStream.pipe( ui.log );\n\n// Or simply write output\nui.log.write(\"something just happened.\");\nui.log.write(\"Almost over, standby!\");\n\n// During processing, update the bottom bar content to display a loader\n// or output a progress bar, etc\nui.updateBottomBar(\"new bottom bar content\");\n```\n\n#### Prompt - `inquirer.ui.Prompt`\n\nThis is UI layout used to run prompt. This layout is returned by `inquirer.prompt` and you should probably always use `inquirer.prompt` to interface with this UI.\n\n\n## Reactive interface\n\nInternally, Inquirer uses the [JS reactive extension](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) to handle events and async flows.\n\nThis mean you can take advantage of this feature to provide more advanced flows. For example, you can dynamically add questions to be asked:\n\n```js\nvar prompts = Rx.Observable.create(function( obs ) {\n  obs.onNext({ /* question... */ });\n  setTimeout(function () {\n    obs.onNext({ /* question... */ });\n    obs.onCompleted();\n  });\n});\n\ninquirer.prompt(prompts);\n```\n\nAnd using the `process` property, you have access to more fine grained callbacks:\n\n```js\ninquirer.prompt(prompts).process.subscribe(\n  onEachAnswer,\n  onError,\n  onComplete\n);\n```\n\n## Support (OS Terminals)\n\nYou should expect mostly good support for the CLI below. This does not mean we won't\nlook at issues found on other command line - feel free to report any!\n\n- **Mac OS**:\n  - Terminal.app\n  - iTerm\n- **Windows**:\n  - cmd.exe\n  - Powershell\n  - Cygwin\n- **Linux (Ubuntu, openSUSE, Arch Linux, etc)**:\n  - gnome-terminal (Terminal GNOME)\n  - konsole\n\n\n## News on the march (Release notes)\n\nPlease refer to the [Github releases section for the changelog](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/releases)\n\n\n## Contributing\n\n**Style Guide**\nPlease brief yourself on [Idiomatic.js](https://github.com/rwldrn/idiomatic.js) style guide with two space indent\n\n**Unit test**\nUnit test are written in [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/). Please add a unit test for every new feature or bug fix. `npm test` to run the test suite.\n\n**Documentation**\nAdd documentation for every API change. Feel free to send corrections\nor better docs!\n\n**Pull Requests**\nSend _fixes_ PR on the `master` branch. Any new features should be send on the `wip`branch.\n\nWe're looking to offer good support for multiple prompts and environments. If you want to\nhelp, we'd like to keep a list of testers for each terminal/OS so we can contact you and\nget feedback before release. Let us know if you want to be added to the list (just tweet\nto @vaxilart) or just add your name to [the wiki](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/wiki/Testers)\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 Simon Boudrias (twitter: @vaxilart)\nLicensed under the MIT license.",

It supports TTL based expiry, making it suitable as a cache or a persistent key-value store.\n\n## Features\n\nThere are a few existing modules similar to Keyv, however Keyv is different because it:\n\n- Isn't bloated\n- Has a simple Promise based API\n- Suitable as a TTL based cache or persistent key-value store\n- [Easily embeddable](#add-cache-support-to-your-module) inside another module\n- Works with any storage that implements the [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) API\n- Handles all JSON types plus `Buffer`\n- Supports namespaces\n- Wide range of [**efficient, well tested**](#official-storage-adapters) storage adapters\n- Connection errors are passed through (db failures won't kill your app)\n- Supports the current active LTS version of Node.js or higher\n\n## Usage\n\nInstall Keyv.\n\n```\nnpm install --save keyv\n```\n\nBy default everything is stored in memory, you can optionally also install a storage adapter.\n\n```\nnpm install --save @keyv/redis\nnpm install --save @keyv/mongo\nnpm install --save @keyv/sqlite\nnpm install --save @keyv/postgres\nnpm install --save @keyv/mysql\nnpm install --save @keyv/etcd\n```\n\nCreate a new Keyv instance, passing your connection string if applicable. Keyv will automatically load the correct storage adapter.\n\n```js\nconst Keyv = require('keyv');\n\n// One of the following\nconst keyv = new Keyv();\nconst keyv = new Keyv('redis://user:pass@localhost:6379');\nconst keyv = new Keyv('mongodb://user:pass@localhost:27017/dbname');\nconst keyv = new Keyv('sqlite://path/to/database.sqlite');\nconst keyv = new Keyv('postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname');\nconst keyv = new Keyv('mysql://user:pass@localhost:3306/dbname');\nconst keyv = new Keyv('etcd://localhost:2379');\n\n// Handle DB connection errors\nkeyv.on('error', err => console.log('Connection Error', err));\n\nawait keyv.set('foo', 'expires in 1 second', 1000); // true\nawait keyv.set('foo', 'never expires'); // true\nawait keyv.get('foo'); // 'never expires'\nawait keyv.delete('foo'); // true\nawait keyv.clear(); // undefined\n```\n\n### Namespaces\n\nYou can namespace your Keyv instance to avoid key collisions and allow you to clear only a certain namespace while using the same database.\n\n```js\nconst users = new Keyv('redis://user:pass@localhost:6379', { namespace: 'users' });\nconst cache = new Keyv('redis://user:pass@localhost:6379', { namespace: 'cache' });\n\nawait users.set('foo', 'users'); // true\nawait cache.set('foo', 'cache'); // true\nawait users.get('foo'); // 'users'\nawait cache.get('foo'); // 'cache'\nawait users.clear(); // undefined\nawait users.get('foo'); // undefined\nawait cache.get('foo'); // 'cache'\n```\n\n### Custom Serializers\n\nKeyv uses [`json-buffer`](https://github.com/dominictarr/json-buffer) for data serialization to ensure consistency across different backends.\n\nYou can optionally provide your own serialization functions to support extra data types or to serialize to something other than JSON.\n\n```js\nconst keyv = new Keyv({ serialize: JSON.stringify, deserialize: JSON.parse });\n```\n\n**Warning:** Using custom serializers means you lose any guarantee of data consistency. You should do extensive testing with your serialisation functions and chosen storage engine.\n\n## Official Storage Adapters\n\nThe official storage adapters are covered by [over 150 integration tests](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/actions/workflows/tests.yaml) to guarantee consistent behaviour. They are lightweight, efficient wrappers over the DB clients making use of indexes and native TTLs where available.\n\nDatabase | Adapter | Native TTL\n---|---|---\nRedis | [@keyv/redis](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/redis) | Yes\nMongoDB | [@keyv/mongo](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/mongo) | Yes \nSQLite | [@keyv/sqlite](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/sqlite) | No \nPostgreSQL | [@keyv/postgres](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/postgres) | No \nMySQL | [@keyv/mysql](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/mysql) | No \nEtcd | [@keyv/etcd](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/etcd) | Yes\nMemcache | [@keyv/memcache](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/memcache) | Yes\n\n## Third-party Storage Adapters\n\nYou can also use third-party storage adapters or build your own. Keyv will wrap these storage adapters in TTL functionality and handle complex types internally.\n\n```js\nconst Keyv = require('keyv');\nconst myAdapter = require('./my-storage-adapter');\n\nconst keyv = new Keyv({ store: myAdapter });\n```\n\nAny store that follows the [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) api will work.\n\n```js\nnew Keyv({ store: new Map() });\n```\n\nFor example, [`quick-lru`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-lru) is a completely unrelated module that implements the Map API.\n\n```js\nconst Keyv = require('keyv');\nconst QuickLRU = require('quick-lru');\n\nconst lru = new QuickLRU({ maxSize: 1000 });\nconst keyv = new Keyv({ store: lru });\n```\n\nThe following are third-party storage adapters compatible with Keyv:\n\n- [quick-lru](https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-lru) - Simple \"Least Recently Used\" (LRU) cache\n- [keyv-file](https://github.com/zaaack/keyv-file) - File system storage adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-dynamodb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv-dynamodb) - DynamoDB storage adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-lru](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv-lru) - LRU storage adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-null](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv-null) - Null storage adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-firestore ](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop/keyv-firestore) – Firebase Cloud Firestore adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-mssql](https://github.com/pmorgan3/keyv-mssql) - Microsoft Sql Server adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-azuretable](https://github.com/howlowck/keyv-azuretable) - Azure Table Storage/API adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-arango](https://github.com/TimMikeladze/keyv-arango) - ArangoDB storage adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-momento](https://github.com/momentohq/node-keyv-adaptor/) - Momento storage adapter for Keyv\n\n## Add Cache Support to your Module\n\nKeyv is designed to be easily embedded into other modules to add cache support. The recommended pattern is to expose a `cache` option in your modules options which is passed through to Keyv. Caching will work in memory by default and users have the option to also install a Keyv storage adapter and pass in a connection string, or any other storage that implements the `Map` API.\n\nYou should also set a namespace for your module so you can safely call `.clear()` without clearing unrelated app data.\n\nInside your module:\n\n```js\nclass AwesomeModule {\n\tconstructor(opts) {\n\t\tthis.cache = new Keyv({\n\t\t\turi: typeof opts.cache === 'string' && opts.cache,\n\t\t\tstore: typeof opts.cache !== 'string' && opts.cache,\n\t\t\tnamespace: 'awesome-module'\n\t\t});\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nNow it can be consumed like this:\n\n```js\nconst AwesomeModule = require('awesome-module');\n\n// Caches stuff in memory by default\nconst awesomeModule = new AwesomeModule();\n\n// After npm install --save keyv-redis\nconst awesomeModule = new AwesomeModule({ cache: 'redis://localhost' });\n\n// Some third-party module that implements the Map API\nconst awesomeModule = new AwesomeModule({ cache: some3rdPartyStore });\n```\n\n## Compression\n\nKeyv supports `gzip` and `brotli` compression. To enable compression, pass the `compress` option to the constructor.\n\n```js\nconst KeyvGzip = require('@keyv/compress-gzip');\nconst Keyv = require('keyv');\n\nconst keyvGzip = new KeyvGzip();\nconst keyv = new Keyv({ compression: KeyvGzip });\n```\n\nYou can also pass a custom compression function to the `compression` option. Following the pattern of the official compression adapters.\n\n### Want to build your own? \n\nGreat! Keyv is designed to be easily extended. You can build your own compression adapter by following the pattern of the official compression adapters based on this interface:\n\n```typescript\ninterface CompressionAdapter {\n\tasync compress(value: any, options?: any);\n\tasync decompress(value: any, options?: any);\n\tasync serialize(value: any);\n\tasync deserialize(value: any);\n}\n```\n\nIn addition to the interface, you can test it with our compression test suite using @keyv/test-suite:\n\n```js\nconst {keyvCompresstionTests} = require('@keyv/test-suite');\nconst KeyvGzip = require('@keyv/compress-gzip');\n\nkeyvCompresstionTests(test, new KeyvGzip());\n```\n\n## API\n\n### new Keyv([uri], [options])\n\nReturns a new Keyv instance.\n\nThe Keyv instance is also an `EventEmitter` that will emit an `'error'` event if the storage adapter connection fails.\n\n### uri\n\nType: `String`<br>\nDefault: `undefined`\n\nThe connection string URI.\n\nMerged into the options object as options.uri.\n\n### options\n\nType: `Object`\n\nThe options object is also passed through to the storage adapter. Check your storage adapter docs for any extra options.\n\n#### options.namespace\n\nType: `String`<br>\nDefault: `'keyv'`\n\nNamespace for the current instance.\n\n#### options.ttl\n\nType: `Number`<br>\nDefault: `undefined`\n\nDefault TTL. Can be overridden by specififying a TTL on `.set()`.\n\n#### options.compression\n\nType: `@keyv/compress-<compression_package_name>`<br>\nDefault: `undefined`\n\nCompression package to use. See [Compression](#compression) for more details.\n\n#### options.serialize\n\nType: `Function`<br>\nDefault: `JSONB.stringify`\n\nA custom serialization function.\n\n#### options.deserialize\n\nType: `Function`<br>\nDefault: `JSONB.parse`\n\nA custom deserialization function.\n\n#### options.store\n\nType: `Storage adapter instance`<br>\nDefault: `new Map()`\n\nThe storage adapter instance to be used by Keyv.\n\n#### options.adapter\n\nType: `String`<br>\nDefault: `undefined`\n\nSpecify an adapter to use. e.g `'redis'` or `'mongodb'`.\n\n### Instance\n\nKeys must always be strings. Values can be of any type.\n\n#### .set(key, value, [ttl])\n\nSet a value.\n\nBy default keys are persistent. You can set an expiry TTL in milliseconds.\n\nReturns a promise which resolves to `true`.\n\n#### .get(key, [options])\n\nReturns a promise which resolves to the retrieved value.\n\n##### options.raw\n\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nIf set to true the raw DB object Keyv stores internally will be returned instead of just the value.\n\nThis contains the TTL timestamp.\n\n#### .delete(key)\n\nDeletes an entry.\n\nReturns a promise which resolves to `true` if the key existed, `false` if not.\n\n#### .clear()\n\nDelete all entries in the current namespace.\n\nReturns a promise which is resolved when the entries have been cleared.\n\n#### .iterator()\n\nIterate over all entries of the current namespace.\n\nReturns a iterable that can be iterated by for-of loops. For example:\n\n```js\n// please note that the \"await\" keyword should be used here\nfor await (const [key, value] of this.keyv.iterator()) {\n  console.log(key, value);\n};\n```\n\n# How to Contribute\n\nIn this section of the documentation we will cover:\n\n1) How to set up this repository locally\n2) How to get started with running commands\n3) How to contribute changes using Pull Requests\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThis package requires the following dependencies to run:\n\n1) [Yarn V1](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)\n3) [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)\n\n## Setting up your workspace\n\nTo contribute to this repository, start by setting up this project locally:\n\n1) Fork this repository into your Git account\n2) Clone the forked repository to your local directory using `git clone`\n3) Install any of the above missing dependencies\n\n## Launching the project\n\nOnce the project is installed locally, you are ready to start up its services:\n\n1) Ensure that your Docker service is running.\n2) From the root directory of your project, run the `yarn` command in the command prompt to install yarn.\n3) Run the `yarn bootstrap` command to  install any necessary dependencies.\n4) Run `yarn test:services:start` to start up this project's Docker container. The container will launch all services within your workspace.\n\n## Available Commands\n\nOnce the project is running, you can execute a variety of commands. The root workspace and each subpackage contain a `package.json` file with a  `scripts` field listing all the commands that can be executed from that directory. This project also supports native `yarn`, and `docker` commands.\n\nHere, we'll cover the primary commands that can be executed from the root directory. Unless otherwise noted, these commands can also be executed from a subpackage. If executed from a subpackage, they will only affect that subpackage, rather than the entire workspace.\n\n### `yarn`\n\nThe `yarn` command installs yarn in the workspace.\n\n### `yarn bootstrap`\n\nThe `yarn bootstrap` command installs all dependencies in the workspace.\n\n### `yarn test:services:start`\n\nThe `yarn test:services:start` command starts up the project's Docker container, launching all services in the workspace. This command must be executed from the root directory.\n\n### `yarn test:services:stop`\n\nThe `yarn test:services:stop` command brings down the project's Docker container, halting all services. This command must be executed from the root directory.\n\n### `yarn test`\n\nThe `yarn test` command runs all tests in the workspace.\n\n### `yarn clean`\n\nThe `yarn clean` command removes yarn and all dependencies installed by yarn. After executing this command, you must repeat the steps in *Setting up your workspace* to rebuild your workspace.\n\n## Contributing Changes\n\nNow that you've set up your workspace, you're ready to contribute changes to the `keyv` repository.\n\n1) Make any changes that you would like to contribute in your local workspace.\n2) After making these changes, ensure that the project's tests still pass by executing the `yarn test` command in the root directory.\n3) Commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.\n4) Navigate to the original `keyv` repository and go the *Pull Requests* tab.\n5) Click the *New pull request* button, and open a pull request for the branch in your repository that contains your changes.\n6) Once your pull request is created, ensure that all checks have passed and that your branch has no conflicts with the base branch. If there are any issues, resolve these changes in your local repository, and then commit and push them to git.\n7) Similarly, respond to any reviewer comments or requests for changes by making edits to your local repository and pushing them to Git.\n8) Once the pull request has been reviewed, those with write access to the branch will be able to merge your changes into the `keyv` repository.\n\nIf you need more information on the steps to create a pull request, you can find a detailed walkthrough in the [Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)\n\n## License\n\nMIT © Jared Wray",

First found is served. (defaults to `false`)\n\n## Example\n\n```js\nconst serve = require('koa-static');\nconst Koa = require('koa');\nconst app = new Koa();\n\n// $ GET /package.json\napp.use(serve('.'));\n\n// $ GET /hello.txt\napp.use(serve('test/fixtures'));\n\n// or use absolute paths\napp.use(serve(__dirname + '/test/fixtures'));\n\napp.listen(3000);\n\nconsole.log('listening on port 3000');\n```\n\n### See also\n\n - [koajs/conditional-get](https://github.com/koajs/conditional-get) Conditional GET support for koa\n - [koajs/compress](https://github.com/koajs/compress) Compress middleware for koa\n - [koajs/mount](https://github.com/koajs/mount) Mount `koa-static` to a specific path\n\n## License\n\n  MIT\n\n[npm-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/koa-static.svg?style=flat-square\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/koa-static\n[github-tag]: http://img.shields.io/github/tag/koajs/static.svg?style=flat-square\n[github-url]: https://github.com/koajs/static/tags\n[travis-image]: https://img.shields.io/travis/koajs/static.svg?style=flat-square\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/koajs/static\n[coveralls-image]: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/koajs/static.svg?style=flat-square\n[coveralls-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/koajs/static?branch=master\n[david-image]: http://img.shields.io/david/koajs/static.svg?style=flat-square\n[david-url]: https://david-dm.org/koajs/static\n[license-image]: http://img.shields.io/npm/l/koa-static.svg?style=flat-square\n[license-url]: LICENSE\n[downloads-image]: http://img.shields.io/npm/dm/koa-static.svg?style=flat-square\n[downloads-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/koa-static\n[gittip-image]: https://img.shields.io/gittip/jonathanong.svg?style=flat-square\n[gittip-url]: https://www.gittip.com/jonathanong/",

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\r\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\r\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\r\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\r\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\r\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\r\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\r\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\r\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\r\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\r\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\r\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\r\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\r\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\r\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\r\n      License.

Here's an example of how to configure it:\n\n### Browser\n\nSay we have the following file `example.html`:\n\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" />\n    <title>Marked Footnote</title>\n\n    <link\n      rel=\"stylesheet\"\n      href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/github-markdown-css/5.2.0/github-markdown-light.min.css\"\n      integrity=\"sha512-bm684OXnsiNuQSyrxuuwo4PHqr3OzxPpXyhT66DA/fhl73e1JmBxRKGnO/nRwWvOZxJLRCmNH7FII+Yn1JNPmg==\"\n      crossorigin=\"anonymous\"\n      referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\"\n    />\n\n    <style>\n      #content {\n        margin: 0 auto;\n        padding: 1rem;\n        max-width: 928px;\n      }\n\n      .sr-only {\n        position: absolute;\n        width: 1px;\n        height: 1px;\n        padding: 0;\n        overflow: hidden;\n        clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);\n        word-wrap: normal;\n        border: 0;\n      }\n    </style>\n  </head>\n\n  <body class=\"markdown-body\">\n    <div id=\"content\"></div>\n\n    <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/marked/marked.min.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/marked-footnote/dist/index.umd.min.js\"></script>\n    <script>\n      const md = `# Example\n\n[^1]: This is a footnote content.\n\nHere is a simple footnote[^1].

You can write a footnote right\n> after your reference to the footnote, and the footnote will still render\n> at the bottom of the Markdown.\n\nAnd our module `example.js` looks as follows:\n\n```js\nimport { readFileSync } from 'node:fs'\nimport { Marked } from 'marked'\nimport markedFootnote from 'marked-footnote'\n\nconst html = new Marked()\n  .use(markedFootnote())\n  .parse(readFileSync('example.md', 'utf8'))\n\nconsole.log(html)\n```\n\nNow, running node `example.js` yields:\n\n```html\n<h1>Example</h1>\n<p>\n  Here is a simple footnote<sup\n    ><a\n      id=\"footnote-ref-1\"\n      href=\"#footnote-1\"\n      data-footnote-ref\n      aria-describedby=\"footnote-label\"\n      >1</a\n    ></sup\n  >.

So you will need to add the style as shown below to your CSS:\n\n```css\n[data-footnote-ref]::before {\n  content: '[';\n}\n\n[data-footnote-ref]::after {\n  content: ']';\n}\n```\n\n## Options\n\nThe marked-footnote extension accepts the following configuration options:\n\n- `prefixId`: The prefix ID for footnotes. Defaults to `'footnote-'`.\n\n- `description`: The description of footnotes, used by `aria-labeledby` attribute. Defaults to `'Footnotes'`.\n\n- `refMarkers`: If set to `true`, it will place footnote reference in square brackets, like this: `[1]`. Defaults to `false`.\n\n## Limitations\n\nWhen considering the use of footnotes in your content, it's important to keep in mind the following accessibility and usability factors:\n\n1. **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Screen readers may not effectively convey footnotes. They tend to read the footnote number without indicating that it's a footnote or using superscript. Additionally, they may not identify the link to the footnote text.\n2. **Accessibility Challenges**: Footnotes pose challenges for all users on a web page. To access them, one often needs to scroll to the end of the page, read the footnote, and then click back to the main content. Not everyone is aware that they should click on the footnote at the end, potentially causing them to lose their place. Moreover, if the same footnote is repeated multiple times, clicking on the link could lead to the wrong location.\n\n## Related\n\nSee [extensions list](https://github.com/bent10/marked-extensions#packages).\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe 💛&nbsp; issues.\n\nWhen committing, please conform to [the semantic-release commit standards](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Please install `commitizen` and the adapter globally, if you have not already.\n\n```bash\nnpm i -g commitizen cz-conventional-changelog\n```\n\nNow you can use `git cz` or just `cz` instead of `git commit` when committing. You can also use `git-cz`, which is an alias for `cz`.\n\n```bash\ngit add . && git cz\n```\n\n## License\n\n![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/bent10/marked-extensions)\n\nA project by [Stilearning](https://stilearning.com) &copy; 2023.",

These owners may\ncontribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the\nfurther production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain\nreputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and\nefforts of others.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation\nof additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work\nand publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\nto, the following:\n\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n  and translate a Work;\n\n  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n\n  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness\n  depicted in a Work;\n\n  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n\n  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n  a Work;\n\n  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n\n  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\napplicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\nunconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright\nand Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\nknown or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\naction), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\nduration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\nextensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\ncopies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\ncommercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes\nthe Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the\ndetriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver\nshall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or\nany other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work\nby the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\njudged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\nshall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\nAffirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver\nis so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,\nnon transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and\nunconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in\nthe Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration\nprovided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)\nin any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any\npurpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or\npromotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as\nof the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work.

    "licenseText": "# napi-wasm\n\nAn implementation of the [napi](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html) API for WASM. Enables using some native Node modules in browsers and other environments.\n\n## Setup\n\nTo use napi-wasm, there are a few requirements:\n\n1. Configure your linker to export an indirect function table. With ldd, this is the `--export-table` flag. This enables JavaScript to call callback functions registered by WASM. It is exposed in the WebAssembly exports as `__indirect_function_table`.\n2. Export a function from your WASM build named `napi_register_module_v1` (Node's default), or `napi_register_wasm_v1` for WASM-specific builds. This is called during initialization to setup the `exports` object for your module. It receives an environment and an exports object pointer as arguments, which you can add properties to.\n3. Include a function named `napi_wasm_malloc` in your WASM build. This is called from JavaScript by napi-wasm to allocate memory in the WASM heap. It should accept a `uint32` size argument indicating the number of bytes to allocate, and return a `uint8` pointer to allocated memory.\n4. Compile for the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target.\n\n### In Rust\n\nThe above steps should apply for any programming language, but here's an example in Rust. First, define a `napi_wasm_malloc` function so JavaScript can allocate memory in the WASM heap using the default allocator.\n\n```rust\nuse std::alloc::{alloc, Layout};\n\n#[no_mangle]\npub extern \"C\" fn napi_wasm_malloc(size: usize) -> *mut u8 {\n  let align = std::mem::align_of::<usize>();\n  if let Ok(layout) = Layout::from_size_align(size, align) {\n    unsafe {\n      if layout.size() > 0 {\n        let ptr = alloc(layout);\n        if !ptr.is_null() {\n          return ptr;\n        }\n      } else {\n        return align as *mut u8;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  std::process::abort();\n}\n```\n\nNext, implement `napi_register_wasm_v1` to register your module exports. We'll use the [napi-rs](https://github.com/napi-rs/napi-rs) bindings in this example to make it a bit nicer than calling C APIs directly. Note that the napi-rs `#[module_exports]` macro currently doesn't work in WASM because Rust doesn't support ctor setup functions in WASM targets yet, so we'll need to do this manually.\n\n```rust\nuse napi::{Env, JsObject, NapiValue};\n\n#[no_mangle]\npub unsafe extern \"C\" fn napi_register_wasm_v1(raw_env: napi::sys::napi_env, raw_exports: napi::sys::napi_value) {\n  let env = Env::from_raw(raw_env);\n  let exports = JsObject::from_raw_unchecked(raw_env, raw_exports);\n\n  exports.create_named_method(\"transform\", transform);\n}\n\n#[js_function(1)]\nfn transform(ctx: CallContext) -> napi::Result<JsUnknown> {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nTo compile, you need to export a function table and use the correct target.\n\n```shell\n RUSTFLAGS=\"-C link-arg=--export-table\" cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown\n```\n\nThis will output a file in `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/YOUR_CRATE.wasm` which you can load in a JavaScript environment.\n\nYou can also put the rust flags in a `.cargo/config.toml` file so you don't need to provide the environment variable each time you run `cargo build`.\n\n```toml\n[target.wasm32-unknown-unknown]\nrustflags = [\"-C\", \"link-arg=--export-table\"]\n```\n\n### Loading\n\nTo load a WASM file and initialize a napi environment, you'll need to import the `napi-wasm` package. You instantiate a WASM module as usual, providing `napi` as the `env` import key. This provides the napi functions for your WASM module to use.\n\nThen, pass the WASM instance to the `Environment` constructor to setup a napi environment. This will call `napi_register_wasm_v1` or `napi_register_module_v1` to setup the exports object. Then you can call functions on the exports object as you would in Node.\n\n```js\nimport { Environment, napi } from 'napi-wasm';\n\n// Construct a URL and instantiate a WebAssembly module as usual.\nconst url = new URL('path/to/lib.wasm', import.meta.url);\nconst { instance } = await WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch(url), {\n  env: napi\n});\n\n// Create an environment.\nlet env = new Environment(instance);\nlet exports = env.exports;\n\n// Use exports as usual!\nexports.transform({\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\nWhen you are done with an `Environment`, call the `destroy()` function to clean up memory.",

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n          NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.",

This means `readline2` change some behaviors and as so is **not** meant to be an exact drop-in replacement.\n\nThis project is extracted from the core of [Inquirer.js interactive prompt interface](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js) to be available as a standalone module.\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\n**Installation**: `npm install --save readline2`\n\n### readline2.createInterface(options); -> {Interface}\n\nPresent the same API as [Node.js `readline.createInterface()`](http://nodejs.org/api/readline.html)\n\n#### Improvements\n- Default `options.input` as `process.stdin`\n- Default `options.output` as `process.stdout`\n- `interface.stdout` is wrapped in a [MuteStream](https://github.com/isaacs/mute-stream)\n- Prevent `up` and `down` keys from moving through history inside the readline\n- Fix cursor position after a line refresh when the `Interface` prompt contains ANSI colors\n- Correctly return the cursor position when faced with implicit line returns\n\n\nLicense\n-------------\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Simon Boudrias (twitter: [@vaxilart](https://twitter.com/Vaxilart))\nLicensed under the MIT license.",

This includes files in which no replacements were made.\n\nEach result contains the following values:\n\n- `file`: The path to the file that was processed\n- `hasChanged`: Flag to indicate if the file was changed or not\n\n```js\nconst results = replace.sync({\n  files: 'path/to/files/*.html',\n  from: /foo/g,\n  to: 'bar',\n});\n\nconsole.log(results);\n\n// [\n//   {\n//     file: 'path/to/files/file1.html',\n//     hasChanged: true,\n//   },\n//   {\n//     file: 'path/to/files/file2.html',\n//     hasChanged: true,\n//   },\n//   {\n//     file: 'path/to/files/file3.html',\n//     hasChanged: false,\n//   },\n// ]\n\n```\n\nTo get an array of changed files, simply map the results as follows:\n\n```js\nconst changedFiles = results\n  .filter(result => result.hasChanged)\n  .map(result => result.file);\n```\n\n### Counting matches and replacements\nBy setting the `countMatches` configuration flag to `true`, the number of matches and replacements per file will be counted and present in the results array.\n\n- `numMatches`: Indicates the number of times a match was found in the file\n- `numReplacements`: Indicates the number of times a replacement was made in the file\n\nNote that the number of matches can be higher than the number of replacements if a match and replacement are the same string.\n\n```js\nconst results = replace.sync({\n  files: 'path/to/files/*.html',\n  from: /foo/g,\n  to: 'bar',\n  countMatches: true,\n});\n\nconsole.log(results);\n\n// [\n//   {\n//     file: 'path/to/files/file1.html',\n//     hasChanged: true,\n//     numMatches: 3,\n//     numReplacements: 3,\n//   },\n//   {\n//     file: 'path/to/files/file2.html',\n//     hasChanged: true,\n//     numMatches: 1,\n//     numReplacements: 1,\n//   },\n//   {\n//     file: 'path/to/files/file3.html',\n//     hasChanged: false,\n//     numMatches: 0,\n//     numReplacements: 0,\n//   },\n// ]\n```\n\n### Custom processor\n\nFor advanced usage where complex processing is needed it's possible to use a callback that will receive content as an argument and should return it processed.\n\n```js\nconst results = replace.sync({\n  files: 'path/to/files/*.html',\n  processor: (input) => input.replace(/foo/g, 'bar'),\n});\n```\n\n### Array of custom processors\n\nPassing processor function also supports passing an array of functions that will be executed sequentially\n\n```js\nfunction someProcessingA(input) {\n  const chapters = input.split('###')\n  chapters[1] = chapters[1].replace(/foo/g, 'bar')\n  return chapters.join('###')\n}\n\nfunction someProcessingB(input) {\n  return input.replace(/foo/g, 'bar')\n}\n\nconst results = replace.sync({\n  files: 'path/to/files/*.html',\n  processor: [someProcessingA, someProcessingB],\n});\n```\n\n## Advanced usage\n\n### Replace a single file or glob\n```js\nconst options = {\n  files: 'path/to/file',\n};\n```\n\n### Replace multiple files or globs\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  files: [\n    'path/to/file',\n    'path/to/other/file',\n    'path/to/files/*.html',\n    'another/**/*.path',\n  ],\n};\n```\n\n### Replace first occurrence only\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  from: 'foo',\n  to: 'bar',\n};\n```\n\n### Replace all occurrences\nPlease note that the value specified in the `from` parameter is passed straight to the native [String replace method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace). As such, if you pass a string as the `from` parameter, it will _only replace the first occurrence_.\n\nTo replace multiple occurrences at once, you must use a regular expression for the `from` parameter with the global flag enabled, e.g. `/foo/g`.\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  from: /foo/g,\n  to: 'bar',\n};\n```\n\n### Multiple values with the same replacement\n\nThese will be replaced sequentially.\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  from: [/foo/g, /baz/g],\n  to: 'bar',\n};\n```\n\n### Multiple values with different replacements\n\nThese will be replaced sequentially.\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  from: [/foo/g, /baz/g],\n  to: ['bar', 'bax'],\n};\n```\n\n### Custom regular expressions\n\nUse the [RegExp](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp) constructor to create any regular expression.\n\n```js\nconst str = 'foo';\nconst regex = new RegExp('^' + str + 'bar', 'i');\nconst options = {\n  from: regex,\n  to: 'bar',\n};\n```\n\n### Using callbacks for `from`\nYou can also specify a callback that returns a string or a regular expression. The callback receives the name of the file in which the replacement is being performed, thereby allowing the user to tailor the search string. The following example uses a callback to produce a search string dependent on the filename:\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  files: 'path/to/file',\n  from: (file) => new RegExp(file, 'g'),\n  to: 'bar',\n};\n```\n\n### Using callbacks for `to`\nAs the `to` parameter is passed to the native [String replace method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace), you can also specify a callback. The following example uses a callback to convert matching strings to lowercase:\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  files: 'path/to/file',\n  from: /SomePattern[A-Za-z-]+/g,\n  to: (match) => match.toLowerCase(),\n};\n```\n\nThis callback provides for an extra argument above the String replace method, which is the name of the file in which the replacement is being performed. The following example replaces the matched string with the filename:\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  files: 'path/to/file',\n  from: /SomePattern[A-Za-z-]+/g,\n  to: (...args) => args.pop(),\n};\n```\n\n### Ignore a single file or glob\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  ignore: 'path/to/ignored/file',\n};\n```\n\n### Ignore multiple files or globs\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  ignore: [\n    'path/to/ignored/file',\n    'path/to/other/ignored_file',\n    'path/to/ignored_files/*.html',\n    'another/**/*.ignore',\n  ],\n};\n```\n\nPlease note that there is an [open issue with Glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/issues/309) that causes ignored patterns to be ignored when using a `./` prefix in your files glob. To work around this, simply remove the prefix, e.g. use `**/*` instead of `./**/*`.\n\n### Allow empty/invalid paths\nIf set to true, empty or invalid paths will fail silently and no error will be thrown. For asynchronous replacement only. Defaults to `false`.\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  allowEmptyPaths: true,\n};\n```\n\n### Disable globs\nYou can disable globs if needed using this flag. Use this when you run into issues with file paths like files like `//SERVER/share/file.txt`. Defaults to `false`.\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  disableGlobs: true,\n};\n```\n\n### Specify glob configuration\nSpecify configuration passed to the [glob](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) call:\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  glob: {\n    //Glob settings here\n    dot: true, //E.g. to include file names starting with a dot\n  },\n};\n```\n\nPlease note that the setting `nodir` will always be passed as `false`.\n\n### Making replacements on network drives\nTo make replacements in files on network drives, you may need to specify the UNC path as the `cwd` config option. This will then be passed to glob and prefixed to your paths accordingly. See [#56](https://github.com/adamreisnz/replace-in-file/issues/56) for more details.\n\n### Specify character encoding\nUse a different character encoding for reading/writing files. Defaults to `utf-8`.\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  encoding: 'utf8',\n};\n```\n\n### Dry run\nTo do a dry run without actually making replacements, for testing purposes. Defaults to `false`.\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  dry: true,\n};\n```\n\n## CLI usage\n\n```sh\nreplace-in-file from to some/file.js,some/**/glob.js\n  [--configFile=replace-config.js]\n  [--ignore=ignore/files.js,ignore/**/glob.js]\n  [--encoding=utf-8]\n  [--disableGlobs]\n  [--isRegex]\n  [--verbose]\n  [--quiet]\n  [--dry]\n```\n\nMultiple files or globs can be replaced by providing a comma separated list.\n\nThe flags `--disableGlobs`, `--ignore` and `--encoding` are supported in the CLI.\n\nThe setting `allowEmptyPaths` is not supported in the CLI as the replacement is\nsynchronous, and this setting is only relevant for asynchronous replacement.\n\nTo list the changed files, use the `--verbose` flag. Success output can be suppressed by using the `--quiet` flag.\n\nTo do a dry run without making any actual changes, use `--dry`.\n\nA regular expression may be used for the `from` parameter by specifying the `--isRegex` flag.\n\nThe `from` and `to` parameters, as well as the files list, can be omitted if you provide this\ninformation in a configuration file. You can provide a path to a configuration file\n(either Javascript or JSON) with the `--configFile` flag. This path will be resolved using\nNode’s built in `path.resolve()`, so you can pass in an absolute or relative path.\n\n## A note on using globs with the CLI\nWhen using the CLI, the glob pattern is handled by the operating system. But if you specify the glob pattern in the configuration file, the package will use the glob module from the Node modules, and this can lead to different behaviour despite using the same pattern.\n\nFor example, the following will only look at top level files:\n\n```js\n//config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  from: /cat/g,\n  to: 'dog',\n};\n```\n\n```sh\nreplace-in-file **  --configFile=config.js\n```\n\nHowever, this example is recursive:\n\n```js\n//config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  files: '**',\n  from: /cat/g,\n  to: 'dog',\n};\n```\n\n```sh\nreplace-in-file --configFile=config.js\n```\n\nIf you want to do a recursive file search as an argument you must use:\n\n```sh\nreplace-in-file $(ls l {,**/}*)  --configFile=config.js\n```\n\n## Version information\nFrom version 3.0.0 onwards, replace in file requires Node 6 or higher. If you need support for Node 4 or 5, please use version 2.x.x.\n\nFrom version 5.0.0 onwards, replace in file requires Node 8 or higher. If you need support for Node 6, please use version 4.x.x.\n\nSee the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for more information.\n\n## License\n(MIT License)\n\nCopyright 2015-2020, Adam Reis, Co-founder at [Hello Club](https://helloclub.com/?source=npm)",

    "licenseText": "# RxJS Lite Module #\n\nThe Reactive Extensions for JavaScript Lite version is a lightweight version of the Reactive Extensions for JavaScript which covers most of the day to day operators you might use all in a single library.  Functionality such as bridging to events, promises, callbacks, Node.js-style callbacks, time-based operations and more are built right in.  This comes with `rx.lite.js` which is for use in modern development environments such as > IE9 and server-side environments such as Node.js.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThere are a number of ways to get

lots of ways to contribute to the project, and we appreciate our [contributors](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/wiki/Contributors).  If you wish to contribute, check out our [style guide]((https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/tree/master/doc/contributing)).\n\nYou can contribute by reviewing and sending feedback on code checkins, suggesting and trying out new features as they are implemented, submit bugs and help us verify fixes as they are checked in, as well as submit code fixes or code contributions of your own. Note that all code submissions will be rigorously reviewed and tested by the Rx Team, and only those that meet an extremely high bar for both quality and design/roadmap appropriateness will be merged into the source.\n\n## License ##\n\nCopyright (c) Microsoft Open Technologies, Inc.

For the purposes\n      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\n      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\n      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\n\n      \"Contribution\" shall mean any work of authorship, including\n      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions\n      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally\n      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner\n      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of\n      the copyright owner.

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

For example, [cryptico](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cryptico),\nan RSA encryption package, [uses the wrong form](\nhttps://github.com/wwwtyro/cryptico/blob/9291ece6/api.js#L264),\nand thus secretly makes `Math.random()` perfectly predictable.\nThe cryptico library (and any other library that does this)\nshould not be trusted in a security-sensitive application.\n\n\nOther Fast PRNG Algorithms\n--------------------------\n\nThe package includes some other fast PRNGs.  To use Johannes Baagøe's\nextremely fast Alea PRNG:\n\n\n```html\n<script src=\"//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/seedrandom/3.0.5/lib/alea.min.js\">\n</script>\n```\n\n```js\n// Use alea for Johannes Baagøe's clever and fast floating-point RNG.\nvar arng = new alea('hello.');\n\n// By default provides 32 bits of randomness in a float.\nconsole.log(arng());               // Always 0.4783254903741181\n\n// Use \"double\" to get 56 bits of randomness.\nconsole.log(arng.double());        // Always 0.8297006866124559\n\n// Use \"int32\" to get a 32 bit (signed) integer.\nconsole.log(arng.int32());         // Always 1076136327\n```\n\nBesides alea, there are several other faster PRNGs available.\nNote that none of these fast PRNGs provide autoseeding: you\nneed to provide your own seed (or use the default autoseeded\nseedrandom to make a seed).\n\n|PRNG name  | Time vs native | Period      | Author               |\n|-----------|----------------|-------------|----------------------|\n|`alea`     |  1.95 ns, 0.9x | ~2^116      | Baagøe               |\n|`xor128`   |  2.04 ns, 0.9x | 2^128-1     | Marsaglia            |\n|`tychei`   |  2.32 ns, 1.1x | ~2^127      | Neves/Araujo (ChaCha)|\n|`xorwow`   |  2.40 ns, 1.1x | 2^192-2^32  | Marsaglia            |\n|`xor4096`  |  2.40 ns, 1.1x | 2^4096-2^32 | Brent (xorgens)      |\n|`xorshift7`|  2.64 ns, 1.3x | 2^256-1     | Panneton/L'ecuyer    |\n|`quick`    |  3.80 ns, 1.8x | ~2^1600     | Bau (ARC4)           |\n\n(Timings were done on node v0.12.2 on a single-core Google Compute Engine\ninstance.  `quick` is just the 32-bit version of the RC4-based PRNG\noriginally packaged with seedrandom.)\n\n\nCJS / Node.js usage\n-------------------\n\n```\nnpm install seedrandom\n```\n\n```js\n// Local PRNG: does not affect Math.random.\nvar seedrandom = require('seedrandom');\nvar rng = seedrandom('hello.');\nconsole.log(rng());                  // Always 0.9282578795792454\n\n// Global PRNG: set Math.random.\nseedrandom('hello.', { global: true });\nconsole.log(Math.random());          // Always 0.9282578795792454\n\n// Autoseeded ARC4-based PRNG.\nrng = seedrandom();\nconsole.log(rng());                  // Reasonably unpredictable.\n\n// Mixing accumulated entropy.\nrng = seedrandom('added entropy.', { entropy: true });\nconsole.log(rng());                  // As unpredictable as added entropy.\n\n// Using alternate algorithms, as listed above.\nvar rng2 = seedrandom.xor4096('hello.')\nconsole.log(rng2());\n```\n\nStarting in version 3, when using via require('seedrandom'), the global\n`Math.seedrandom` is no longer available.\n\n\nRequire.js usage\n----------------\n\nSimilar to Node.js usage:\n\n```\nbower install seedrandom\n```\n\n```\nrequire(['seedrandom'], function(seedrandom) {\n  var rng = seedrandom('hello.');\n  console.log(rng());                  // Always 0.9282578795792454\n});\n```\n\n\nNetwork seeding\n---------------\n\n```html\n<script src=//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/seedrandom/3.0.5/seedrandom.min.js>\n</script>\n<!-- Seeds using urandom bits from a server. -->\n<script src=//jsonlib.appspot.com/urandom?callback=Math.seedrandom>\n</script>\n\n<!-- Seeds mixing in random.org bits -->\n<script>\n(function(x, u, s){\n  try {\n    // Make a synchronous request to random.org.\n    x.open('GET', u, false);\n    x.send();\n    s = unescape(x.response.trim().replace(/^|\\s/g, '%'));\n  } finally {\n    // Seed with the response, or autoseed on failure.\n    Math.seedrandom(s, !!s);\n  }\n})(new XMLHttpRequest, 'https://www.random.org/integers/' +\n  '?num=256&min=0&max=255&col=1&base=16&format=plain&rnd=new');\n</script>\n```\n\nReseeding using user input\n--------------------------\n\n```js\nvar seed = Math.seedrandom();        // Use prng with an automatic seed.\ndocument.write(Math.random());       // Pretty much unpredictable x.\n\nvar rng = new Math.seedrandom(seed); // A new prng with the same seed.\ndocument.write(rng());               // Repeat the 'unpredictable' x.\n\nfunction reseed(event, count) {      // Define a custom entropy collector.\n  var t = [];\n  function w(e) {\n    t.push([e.pageX, e.pageY, +new Date]);\n    if (t.length < count) { return; }\n    document.removeEventListener(event, w);\n    Math.seedrandom(t, { entropy: true });\n  }\n  document.addEventListener(event, w);\n}\nreseed('mousemove', 100);            // Reseed after 100 mouse moves.\n```\n\nThe \"pass\" option can be used to get both the prng and the seed.\nThe following returns both an autoseeded prng and the seed as an object,\nwithout mutating Math.random:\n\n```js\nvar obj = Math.seedrandom(null, { pass: function(prng, seed) {\n  return { random: prng, seed: seed };\n}});\n```\n\n\nSaving and Restoring PRNG state\n-------------------------------\n\n```js\nvar seedrandom = Math.seedrandom;\nvar saveable = seedrandom(\"secret-seed\", {state: true});\nfor (var j = 0; j < 1e5; ++j) saveable();\nvar saved = saveable.state();\nvar replica = seedrandom(\"\", {state: saved});\nassert(replica() == saveable());\n```\n\nIn normal use the prng is opaque and its internal state cannot be accessed.\nHowever, if the \"state\" option is specified, the prng gets a state() method\nthat returns a plain object the can be used to reconstruct a prng later in\nthe same state (by passing that saved object back as the state option).\n\n\nVersion notes\n-------------\n\nThe random number sequence is the same as version 1.0 for string seeds.\n\n* Version 2.0 changed the sequence for non-string seeds.\n* Version 2.1 speeds seeding and uses window.crypto to autoseed if present.\n* Version 2.2 alters non-crypto autoseeding to sweep up entropy from plugins.\n* Version 2.3 adds support for \"new\", module loading, and a null seed arg.\n* Version 2.3.1 adds a build environment, module packaging, and tests.\n* Version 2.3.4 fixes bugs on IE8, and switches to MIT license.\n* Version 2.3.6 adds a readable options object argument.\n* Version 2.3.10 adds support for node.js crypto (contributed by ctd1500).\n* Version 2.3.11 adds an option to load and save internal state.\n* Version 2.4.0 adds implementations of several other fast PRNGs.\n* Version 2.4.2 adds an implementation of Baagoe's very fast Alea PRNG.\n* Version 2.4.3 ignores nodejs crypto when under browserify.\n* Version 2.4.4 avoids strict mode problem with global this reference.\n* Version 3.0.1 removes Math.seedrandom for require('seedrandom') users.\n* Version 3.0.3 updates package.json for CDN entrypoints.\n* Version 3.0.5 removes eval to avoid triggering content-security policy.\n\nThe standard ARC4 key scheduler cycles short keys, which means that\nseedrandom('ab') is equivalent to seedrandom('abab') and 'ababab'.\nTherefore it is a good idea to add a terminator to avoid trivial\nequivalences on short string seeds, e.g., Math.seedrandom(str + '\\0').\nStarting with version 2.0, a terminator is added automatically for\nnon-string seeds, so seeding with the number 111 is the same as seeding\nwith '111\\0'.\n\nWhen seedrandom() is called with zero args or a null seed, it uses a\nseed drawn from the browser crypto object if present.  If there is no\ncrypto support, seedrandom() uses the current time, the native rng,\nand a walk of several DOM objects to collect a few bits of entropy.\n\nEach time the one- or two-argument forms of seedrandom are called,\nentropy from the passed seed is accumulated in a pool to help generate\nfuture seeds for the zero- and two-argument forms of seedrandom.\n\nOn speed - This javascript implementation of Math.random() is several\ntimes slower than the built-in Math.random() because it is not native\ncode, but that is typically fast enough.  Some details (timings on\nChrome 25 on a 2010 vintage macbook):\n\n* seeded Math.random()          - avg less than 0.0002 milliseconds per call\n* seedrandom('explicit.')       - avg less than 0.2 milliseconds per call\n* seedrandom('explicit.', true) - avg less than 0.2 milliseconds per call\n* seedrandom() with crypto      - avg less than 0.2 milliseconds per call\n\nAutoseeding without crypto is somewhat slow, about 20-30 milliseconds on\na 2012 windows 7 1.5ghz i5 laptop, as seen on Firefox 19, IE 10, and Opera.\nSeeded rng calls themselves are fast across these browsers, with slowest\nnumbers on Opera at about 0.0005 ms per seeded Math.random().\n\n\nLICENSE (MIT)\n-------------\n\nCopyright 2019 David Bau.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.",

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

for advanced users and use cases.\n\n## Using Task Promises\n\nEach task in the API returns the `simpleGit` instance for chaining together multiple tasks, and each\nstep in the chain is also a `Promise` that can be `await` ed in an `async` function or returned in a\n`Promise` chain.\n\n```javascript\nconst git = simpleGit();\n\n// chain together tasks to await final result\nawait git.init().addRemote('origin', '...remote.git');\n\n// or await each step individually\nawait git.init();\nawait git.addRemote('origin', '...remote.git');\n```\n\n### Catching errors in async code\n\nTo catch errors in async code, either wrap the whole chain in a try/catch:\n\n```javascript\nconst git = simpleGit();\ntry {\n   await git.init();\n   await git.addRemote(name, repoUrl);\n} catch (e) {\n   /* handle all errors here */\n}\n```\n\nor catch individual steps to permit the main chain to carry on executing rather than\njumping to the final `catch` on the first error:\n\n```javascript\nconst git = simpleGit();\ntry {\n   await git.init().catch(ignoreError);\n   await git.addRemote(name, repoUrl);\n} catch (e) {\n   /* handle all errors here */\n}\n\nfunction ignoreError() {}\n```\n\n## Using Task Callbacks\n\nIn addition to returning a promise, each method can also be called with a trailing callback argument\nto handle the result of the task.\n\n```javascript\nconst git = simpleGit();\ngit.init(onInit).addRemote('origin', 'git@github.com:steveukx/git-js.git', onRemoteAdd);\n\nfunction onInit(err, initResult) {}\nfunction onRemoteAdd(err, addRemoteResult) {}\n```\n\nIf any of the steps in the chain result in an error, all pending steps will be cancelled, see the\n[parallel tasks](<(#concurrent--parallel-requests)>) section for more information on how to run tasks in parallel rather than in series .\n\n## Task Responses\n\nWhether using a trailing callback or a Promise, tasks either return the raw `string` or `Buffer` response from the\n`git` binary, or where possible a parsed interpretation of the response.\n\nFor type details of the response for each of the tasks, please see the [TypeScript definitions](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/simple-git/typings/simple-git.d.ts).\n\n# Upgrading from Version 2\n\nFrom v3 of `simple-git` you can now import as an ES module, Common JS module or as TypeScript with bundled type\ndefinitions. Upgrading from v2 will be seamless for any application not relying on APIs that were marked as deprecated\nin v2 (deprecation notices were logged to `stdout` as `console.warn` in v2).\n\n# API\n\n|

For example:\n\n```javascript\n// results in 'git pull origin master --no-rebase'\ngit.pull('origin', 'master', { '--no-rebase': null });\n\n// results in 'git pull origin master --rebase=true'\ngit.pull('origin', 'master', { '--rebase': 'true' });\n```\n\n### Options as an Array\n\nOptions can also be supplied as an array of strings to be merged into the task's commands\nin the same way as when an object is used:\n\n```javascript\n// results in 'git pull origin master --no-rebase'\ngit.pull('origin', 'master', ['--no-rebase']);\n```\n\n# Release History\n\nMajor release 3.x changes the packaging of the library, making it consumable as a CommonJS module, ES module as well as\nwith TypeScript (see [usage](#usage) above). The library is now published as a single file, so please ensure your\napplication hasn't been making use of non-documented APIs by importing from a sub-directory path.\n\nSee also:\n\n- [release notes v3](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/simple-git/CHANGELOG.md)\n- [release notes v2](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/RELEASE-NOTES-V2.md)\n\n# Concurrent / Parallel Requests\n\nWhen the methods of `simple-git` are chained together, they create an execution chain that will run in series, useful\nfor when the tasks themselves are order-dependent, eg:\n\n```typescript\nsimpleGit().init().addRemote('origin', 'https://some-repo.git').fetch();\n```\n\nEach task requires that the one before it has been run successfully before it is called, any errors in a\nstep of the chain should prevent later steps from being attempted.\n\nWhen the methods of `simple-git` are called on the root instance (ie: `git = simpleGit()`) rather than chained\noff another task, it starts a new chain and will not be affected failures in tasks already being run. Useful\nfor when the tasks are independent of each other, eg:\n\n```typescript\nconst git = simpleGit();\nconst results = await Promise.all([\n   git.raw('rev-parse', '--show-cdup').catch(swallow),\n   git.raw('rev-parse', '--show-prefix').catch(swallow),\n]);\nfunction swallow(err) {\n   return null;\n}\n```\n\nEach `simple-git` instance limits the number of spawned child processes that can be run simultaneously and\nmanages the queue of pending tasks for you. Configure this value by passing an options object to the\n`simpleGit` function, eg:\n\n```typescript\nconst git = simpleGit({ maxConcurrentProcesses: 10 });\n```\n\nTreating tasks called on the root instance as the start of separate chains is a change to the behaviour of\n`simple-git` and was added in version `2.11.0`.\n\n# Complex Requests\n\nWhen no suitable wrapper exists in the interface for creating a request, run the command directly\nusing `git.raw([...], handler)`. The array of commands are passed directly to the `git` binary:\n\n```javascript\nconst path = '/path/to/repo';\nconst commands = ['config', '--global', 'advice.pushNonFastForward', 'false'];\n\n// using an array of commands and node-style callback\nsimpleGit(path).raw(commands, (err, result) => {\n   // err is null unless this command failed\n   // result is the raw output of this command\n});\n\n// using a var-args of strings and awaiting rather than using the callback\nconst result = await simpleGit(path).raw(...commands);\n\n// automatically trim trailing white-space in responses\nconst result = await simpleGit(path, { trimmed: true }).raw(...commands);\n```\n\n# Authentication\n\nThe easiest way to supply a username / password to the remote host is to include it in the URL, for example:\n\n```javascript\nconst USER = 'something';\nconst PASS = 'somewhere';\nconst REPO = 'github.com/username/private-repo';\n\nconst remote = `https://${USER}:${PASS}@${REPO}`;\n\nsimpleGit()\n   .clone(remote)\n   .then(() => console.log('finished'))\n   .catch((err) => console.error('failed: ', err));\n```\n\nBe sure to not enable debug logging when using this mechanism for authentication\nto ensure passwords aren't logged to stdout.\n\n# Environment Variables\n\nPass one or more environment variables to the child processes spawned by `simple-git` with the `.env` method which\nsupports passing either an object of name=value pairs or setting a single variable at a time:\n\n```javascript\nconst GIT_SSH_COMMAND = 'ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no';\n\nsimpleGit()\n   .env('GIT_SSH_COMMAND', GIT_SSH_COMMAND)\n   .status((err, status) => {\n      /*  */\n   });\n\nsimpleGit()\n   .env({ ...process.env, GIT_SSH_COMMAND })\n   .status()\n   .then((status) => {})\n   .catch((err) => {});\n```\n\nNote - when passing environment variables into the child process, these will replace the standard `process.env`\nvariables, the example above creates a new object based on `process.env` but with the `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` property added.\n\n# Exception Handling\n\nWhen the `git` process exits with a non-zero status (or in some cases like `merge` the git process exits with a\nsuccessful zero code but there are conflicts in the merge) the task will reject with a `GitError` when there is no\navailable parser to handle the error or a\n`GitResponseError` for when there is.\n\nSee the `err` property of the callback:\n\n```javascript\ngit.merge((err, mergeSummary) => {\n   if (err.git) {\n      mergeSummary = err.git; // the failed mergeSummary\n   }\n});\n```\n\nCatch errors with try/catch in async code:\n\n```javascript\ntry {\n   const mergeSummary = await git.merge();\n   console.log(`Merged ${mergeSummary.merges.length} files`);\n} catch (err) {\n   // err.message - the string summary of the error\n   // err.stack - some stack trace detail\n   // err.git - where a parser was able to run, this is the parsed content\n\n   console.error(`Merge resulted in ${err.git.conflicts.length} conflicts`);\n}\n```\n\nCatch errors with a `.catch` on the promise:\n\n```javascript\nconst mergeSummary = await git.merge().catch((err) => {\n   if (err.git) {\n      return err.git;\n   } // the unsuccessful mergeSummary\n   throw err; // some other error, so throw\n});\n\nif (mergeSummary.failed) {\n   console.error(`Merge resulted in ${mergeSummary.conflicts.length} conflicts`);\n}\n```\n\nWith typed errors available in TypeScript\n\n```typescript\nimport { simpleGit, MergeSummary, GitResponseError } from 'simple-git';\ntry {\n   const mergeSummary = await simpleGit().merge();\n   console.log(`Merged ${mergeSummary.merges.length} files`);\n} catch (err) {\n   // err.message - the string summary of the error\n   // err.stack - some stack trace detail\n   // err.git - where a parser was able to run, this is the parsed content\n   const mergeSummary: MergeSummary = (err as GitResponseError<MergeSummary>).git;\n   const conflicts = mergeSummary?.conflicts || [];\n\n   console.error(`Merge resulted in ${conflicts.length} conflicts`);\n}\n```\n\n# Troubleshooting / FAQ\n\n### Enable logging\n\nSee the [debug logging guide](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/DEBUG-LOGGING-GUIDE.md) for logging examples and how to\nmake use of the [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) library's programmatic interface\nin your application.\n\n### Enable Verbose Logging\n\nSee the [debug logging guide](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/DEBUG-LOGGING-GUIDE.md#verbose-logging-options) for\nthe full list of verbose logging options to use with the\n[debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) library.\n\n### Every command returns ENOENT error message\n\nThere are a few potential reasons:\n\n-  `git` isn't available as a binary for the user running the main `node` process, custom paths to the binary can be used\n   with the `.customBinary(...)` API option.\n\n-  the working directory passed in to the main `simple-git` function isn't accessible, check it is read/write accessible\n   by the user running the `node` process. This library uses\n   [@kwsites/file-exists](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kwsites/file-exists) to validate the working directory exists,\n   to output its logs add `@kwsites/file-exists` to your `DEBUG` environment variable. eg:\n\n   `DEBUG=@kwsites/file-exists,simple-git node ./your-app.js`\n\n### Log format fails\n\nThe properties of `git log` are fetched using the `--pretty=format` argument which supports different tokens depending\non the version of `git` - for example the `%D` token used to show the refs was added in git `2.2.3`, for any version\nbefore that please ensure you are supplying your own format object with properties supported by the version of git you\nare using.\n\nFor more details of the supported tokens, please see the\n[official `git log` documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#_pretty_formats)\n\n### Log response properties are out of order\n\nThe properties of `git.log` are fetched using the character sequence `ò` as a delimiter. If your commit messages\nuse this sequence, supply a custom `splitter` in the options, for example: `git.log({ splitter: '💻' })`\n\n### Pull / Diff / Merge summary responses don't recognise any files\n\n-  Enable verbose logs with the environment variable `DEBUG=simple-git:task:*,simple-git:output:*`\n-  Check the output (for example: `simple-git:output:diff:1 [stdOut] 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)`)\n-  Check the `stdOut` output is the same as you would expect to see when running the command directly in terminal\n-  Check the language used in the response is english locale\n\nIn some cases `git` will show progress messages or additional detail on error states in the output for\n`stdErr` that will help debug your issue, these messages are also included in the verbose log.\n\n### Legacy Node Versions\n\nFrom `v3.x`, `simple-git` will drop support for `node.js` version 10 or below, to use in a lower version of node will\nresult in errors such as:\n\n-  `Object.fromEntries is not a function`\n-  `Object.entries is not a function`\n-  `message.flatMap is not a function`\n\nTo resolve these issues, either upgrade to a newer version of node.js or ensure you are using the necessary polyfills\nfrom `core-js` - see [Legacy Node Versions](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/LEGACY_NODE_VERSIONS.md).\n\n# Examples\n\n### using a pathspec to limit the scope of the task\n\nIf the `simple-git` API doesn't explicitly limit the scope of the task being run (ie: `git.add()` requires the files to\nbe added, but `git.status()` will run against the entire repo), add a `pathspec` to the command using trailing options:\n\n```typescript\nimport { simpleGit, pathspec } from \"simple-git\";\n\nconst git = simpleGit();\nconst wholeRepoStatus = await git.status();\nconst subDirStatusUsingOptArray = await git.status([pathspec('sub-dir')]);\nconst subDirStatusUsingOptObject = await git.status({ 'sub-dir': pathspec('sub-dir') });\n```\n\n### async await\n\n```javascript\nasync function status(workingDir) {\n   let statusSummary = null;\n   try {\n      statusSummary = await simpleGit(workingDir).status();\n   } catch (e) {\n      // handle the error\n   }\n\n   return statusSummary;\n}\n\n// using the async function\nstatus(__dirname + '/some-repo').then((status) => console.log(status));\n```\n\n### Initialise a git repo if necessary\n\n```javascript\nconst git = simpleGit(__dirname);\n\ngit.checkIsRepo()\n   .then((isRepo) => !isRepo && initialiseRepo(git))\n   .then(() => git.fetch());\n\nfunction initialiseRepo(git) {\n   return git.init().then(() => git.addRemote('origin', 'https://some.git.repo'));\n}\n```\n\n### Update repo and get a list of tags\n\n```javascript\nsimpleGit(__dirname + '/some-repo')\n   .pull()\n   .tags((err, tags) => console.log('Latest available tag: %s', tags.latest));\n\n// update repo and when there are changes, restart the app\nsimpleGit().pull((err, update) => {\n   if (update && update.summary.changes) {\n      require('child_process').exec('npm restart');\n   }\n});\n```\n\n### Starting a new repo\n\n```javascript\nsimpleGit()\n   .init()\n   .add('./*')\n   .commit('first commit!')\n   .addRemote('origin', 'https://github.com/user/repo.git')\n   .push('origin', 'master');\n```\n\n### push with `-u`\n\n```javascript\nsimpleGit()\n   .add('./*')\n   .commit('first commit!')\n   .addRemote('origin', 'some-repo-url')\n   .push(['-u', 'origin', 'master'], () => console.log('done'));\n```\n\n### Piping to the console for long-running tasks\n\nSee [progress events](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-PROGRESS-EVENTS.md) for more details on\nlogging progress updates.\n\n```javascript\nconst git = simpleGit({\n   progress({ method, stage, progress }) {\n      console.log(`git.${method} ${stage} stage ${progress}% complete`);\n   },\n});\ngit.checkout('https://github.com/user/repo.git');\n```\n\n### Update repo and print messages when there are changes, restart the app\n\n```javascript\n// when using a chain\nsimpleGit()\n   .exec(() => console.log('Starting pull...'))\n   .pull((err, update) => {\n      if (update && update.summary.changes) {\n         require('child_process').exec('npm restart');\n      }\n   })\n   .exec(() => console.log('pull done.'));\n\n// when using async and optional chaining\nconst git = simpleGit();\nconsole.log('Starting pull...');\nif ((await git.pull())?.summary.changes) {\n   require('child_process').exec('npm restart');\n}\nconsole.log('pull done.');\n```\n\n### Get a full commits list, and then only between 0.11.0 and 0.12.0 tags\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log(await simpleGit().log());\nconsole.log(await simpleGit().log('0.11.0', '0.12.0'));\n```\n\n### Set the local configuration for author, then author for an individual commit\n\n```javascript\nsimpleGit()\n   .addConfig('user.name', 'Some One')\n   .addConfig('user.email', 'some@one.com')\n   .commit('committed as \"Some One\"', 'file-one')\n   .commit('committed as \"Another Person\"', 'file-two', {\n      '--author': '\"Another Person <another@person.com>\"',\n   });\n```\n\n### Get remote repositories\n\n```javascript\nsimpleGit().listRemote(['--get-url'], (err, data) => {\n   if (!err) {\n      console.log('Remote url for repository at ' + __dirname + ':');\n      console.log(data);\n   }\n});\n```",

    "copyright": "",
    "licenseText": "# sirv ![CI](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/workflows/CI/badge.svg)\n\n> The optimized and lightweight middleware for serving requests to static assets\n\nYou may use `sirv` as a *very* fast and lightweight alternative to [`serve-static`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve-static).\n\nThe massive performance advantage over `serve-static` is explained by **not** relying on the file system for existence checks on every request. These are expensive interactions and must be avoided whenever possible! Instead, when not in \"dev\" mode, `sirv` performs all its file-system operations upfront and then relies on its cache for future operations.\n\nThis middleware will work out of the box for [Polka](https://github.com/lukeed/polka), Express, and other Express-like frameworks. It will also work with the native `http`, `https` and `http2` modules. It requires _very_ little effort to modify/wrap it for servers that don't accept the `(req, res, next)` signature.\n\n:bulb: For a feature-complete CLI application, check out the sibling [`sirv-cli`](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/tree/master/packages/sirv-cli) package as an alternative to [`zeit/serve`](https://github.com/zeit/serve)~!\n\n## Install\n\n```\n$ npm install --save sirv\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst sirv = require('sirv');\nconst polka = require('polka');\nconst compress = require('compression')();\n\n// Init `sirv` handler\nconst assets = sirv('public', {\n  maxAge: 31536000, // 1Y\n  immutable: true\n});\n\npolka()\n  .use(compress, assets)\n  .use('/api', require('./api'))\n  .listen(3000, err => {\n    if (err) throw err;\n    console.log('> Ready on localhost:3000~!');\n  });\n```\n\n\n## API\n\n### sirv(dir, opts={})\n\nReturns: `Function`\n\nThe returned function is a middleware in the standard Express-like signature: `(req, res, next)`, where `req` is the [`http.IncomingMessage`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage), `res` is the [`http.ServerResponse`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v9.x/docs/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse), and `next` (in this case) is the function to call if no file was found for the given path.\n\nWhen defined, a `next()` callback is always called _instead of_ the [`opts.onNoMatch`](#optsonnomatch) callback. However, unlike `onNoMatch`, your `next()` is given no arguments.\n\n#### dir\nType: `String`<br>\nDefault: `.`\n\nThe directory from which to read and serve assets. It is resolved to an absolute path &mdash; you must provide an absolute path yourself if `process.cwd()` is not the correct assumption.\n\n#### opts.dev\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nEnable \"dev\" mode, which disables/skips caching. Instead, `sirv` will traverse the file system ***on every request***.\n\nAdditionally, `dev` mode will ignore `maxAge` and `immutable` as these options generate a production-oriented `Cache-Control` header value.\n\n> **Important:** Do not use `dev` mode in production!\n\n#### opts.etag\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nGenerate and attach an `ETag` header to responses.\n\n> **Note:** If an incoming request's [`If-None-Match` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-None-Match) matches the `ETag` value, a `304` response is given.\n\n#### opts.dotfiles\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nAllow requests to dotfiles (files or directories beginning with a `.`).\n\n> **Note:** Requests to [`/.well-known/*`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8615) are always allowed.\n\n#### opts.extensions\nType: `Array<String>`<br>\nDefault: `['html', 'htm']`\n\nThe file extension fallbacks to check for if a pathame is not initially found. For example, if a `/login` request cannot find a `login` filename, it will then look for `login.html` and `login.htm` before giving up~!\n\n> **Important:** Actually, `sirv` will **also** look for `login/index.html` and `login/index.htm` before giving up.\n\n#### opts.gzip\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nDetermine if `sirv` look for **precompiled** `*.gz` files.<br>\nMust be enabled _and_ the incoming request's [`Accept Encoding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Encoding) must include \"gzip\" in order for `sirv` to search for the gzip'd alternative.\n\n> **Note:** The `.gz` assumption also applies to the `opts.extensions` list.\n\n```js\n// NOTE: PSEUDO CODE\n// Showing lookup logic\n\n// Request: [Accept-Encoding: gzip] \"/foobar.jpg\"\nlookup([\n  '/foobar.jpg.gz', '/foobar.jpg',\n  '/foobar.jpg.html.gz', '/foobar.jpg/index.html.gz',\n  '/foobar.jpg.htm.gz', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm.gz',\n  '/foobar.jpg.html', '/foobar.jpg/index.html',\n  '/foobar.jpg.htm', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm',\n]);\n\n// Request: [Accept-Encoding: gzip] \"/\"\nlookup([\n  '/index.html.gz',\n  '/index.htm.gz',\n  '/index.html',\n  '/index.htm',\n]);\n```\n\n\n#### opts.brotli\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nDetermine if `sirv` look for **precompiled** `*.br` files.<br>\nMust be enabled _and_ the incoming request's [`Accept Encoding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Encoding) must include either \"br\" or \"brotli\" in order for `sirv` to search for the brotli-compressed alternative.\n\n> **Note:** The `.br` assumption also applies to the `opts.extensions` list.\n\nWhen both `opts.broli` and `opts.gzip` are enabled &mdash; and all conditions are equal &mdash; then the brotli variant always takes priority.\n\n```js\n// NOTE: PSEUDO CODE\n// Showing lookup logic\n\n// Request: [Accept-Encoding: br] \"/foobar.jpg\"\nlookup([\n  '/foobar.jpg.br', '/foobar.jpg',\n  '/foobar.jpg.html.br', '/foobar.jpg/index.html.br',\n  '/foobar.jpg.htm.br', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm.br',\n  '/foobar.jpg.html', '/foobar.jpg/index.html',\n  '/foobar.jpg.htm', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm',\n]);\n\n// Request: [Accept-Encoding: br,gz] \"/\"\nlookup([\n  '/index.html.br'\n  '/index.htm.br'\n  '/index.html.gz'\n  '/index.htm.gz'\n  '/index.html'\n  '/index.htm'\n]);\n```\n\n#### opts.maxAge\nType: `Number`<br>\nDefault: `undefined`\n\nEnables the `Cache-Control` header on responses and sets the `max-age` value (in seconds).<br>\nFor example, `maxAge: 31536000` is equivalent to one year.\n\n#### opts.immutable\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nAppends the [`immutable` directive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control#Revalidation_and_reloading) on your `Cache-Control` header, used for uniquely-named assets that will not change!\n\n> **Important:** Will only work if `opts.maxAge` has a value defined!\n\n#### opts.single\nType: `Boolean` or `String`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nTreat the directory as a single-page application.\n\nWhen `true`, the directory's index page (default `index.html`) will be sent if the request asset does not exist.<br>\nYou may pass a `string` value to use a file _instead of_ `index.html` as your fallback.\n\nFor example, if \"/about\" is requested but no variants of that file exist, then the response for \"/\" is sent instead:\n\n```js\n// Note: This is psuedo code to illustrate what's happening\n\n// Request: \"/about\"\nlet file = find(['/about', '/about.html', '/about.htm', '/about/index.html', '/about.htm']);\nif (file) {\n  send(file);\n} else if (opts.single === true) {\n  file = find(['/', '/index.html', '/index.htm']);\n  send(file);\n} else if (typeof opts.single === 'string') {\n  file = find([opts.single]);\n  send(file);\n} else {\n  // next() or 404\n}\n```\n\n#### opts.ignores\nType: `false` or `Array<String | RegExp>`\n\nSpecify paths/patterns that should ignore the fallback behavior that `opts.single` provides.\n\nBy default, any asset-like path (URLs that end with an extension) will be ignored. This means that, for example, if `/foobar.jpg` is not found, a `404` response is sent instead of the `index.html` fallback.\n\nAdditionally, any `/.well-known/*` pathname ignores the fallback – as do all other dotfile requests when `opts.dotfiles` is enabled.\n\nAny string value(s) will be passed through `new RegExp(value, 'i')` directly.\n\nFinally, you may set `ignores: false` to disable ***all*** ignores, including the defaults. Put differently, this will fallback ***all*** unknown pathnames to your `index.html` (or custom `opts.single` value).\n\n> **Important:** Only has an effect if `opts.single` is enabled.\n\n#### opts.onNoMatch\nType: `Function`\n\nA custom function to run if a file cannot be found for a given request. <br>By default, `sirv` will send a basic `(404) Not found` response.\n\nThe function receives the current `req <IncomingMessage>, res <ServerResponse>` pair for as its two arguments.\n\n> **Note:** This won't run if a `next` callback has been provided to the middleware; see [`sirv`](#sirvdir-opts) description.\n\n#### opts.setHeaders\nType: `Function`\n\nA custom function to append or change any headers on the outgoing response. There is no default.\n\nIts signature is `(res, pathname, stats)`, where `res` is the `ServerResponse`, `pathname` is incoming request path (stripped of queries), and `stats` is the file's result from [`fs.statSync`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_statsync_path).\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT © [Luke Edwards](https://lukeed.com)",

    "licenseText": "# Strict Event Emitter\n\nA type-safe implementation of `EventEmitter` for browser and Node.js.\n\n## Motivation\n\nDespite event emitters potentially accepting any runtime value, defining a strict event contract is crucial when developing complex event-driven architectures. Unfortunately, the native type definitions for Node's `EventEmitter` annotate event names as `string`, which forbids any stricter type validation.\n\n```js\n// index.js\nconst emitter = new EventEmitter()\n\n// Let's say our application expects a \"ping\"\n// event with the number payload.\nemitter.on('ping', (n: number) => {})\n\n// We can, however, emit a different event by mistake.\nemitter.emit('pong', 1)\n\n// Or even the correct event with the wrong data.\nemitter.emit('ping', 'wait, not a number')\n```\n\nThe purpose of this library is to provide an `EventEmitter` instance that can accept a generic describing the expected events contract.\n\n```ts\nimport { Emitter } from 'strict-event-emitter'\n\n// Define a strict events contract where keys\n// represent event names and values represent\n// the list of arguments expected in \".emit()\".\ntype Events = {\n  ping: [number]\n}\n\nconst emitter = new Emitter<Events>()\nemitter.addListener('ping', (n) => {\n  // \"n\" argument type is inferred as \"number'.\n})\n\nemitter.emit('ping', 10) // OK\nemitter.emit('unknown', 10) // TypeError (invalid event name)\nemitter.emit('ping', 'wait, not a number') // TypeError (invalid data)\n```\n\nThis library is also a custom `EventEmitter` implementation, which makes it compatible with other environments, like browsers or React Native.\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install strict-event-emitter\n```\n\n### Use\n\n```ts\nimport { Emitter } from 'strict-event-emitter'\n\n// 1. Define an interface that describes your events.\n// Set event names as the keys, and their expected payloads as values.\ninterface Events {\n  connect: [id: string]\n  disconnect: [id: string]\n}\n\n// 2. Create a strict emitter and pass the previously defined \"Events\"\n// as its first generic argument.\nconst emitter = new Emitter<Events>()\n\n// 3. Use the \"emitter\" the same way you'd use the regular \"EventEmitter\" instance.\nemitter.addListener('connect', (id) => {})\nemitter.emit('connect', 'abc-123')\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT",

    "copyright": "",
    "licenseText": "# Tailwind Config Viewer\n\n![Screenshot of UI](https://github.com/rogden/tailwind-config-viewer/raw/master/ui-example.jpg)\n\nTailwind Config Viewer is a local UI tool for visualizing your Tailwind CSS configuration file. Keep it open during development to quickly reference custom Tailwind values/classes. Easily navigate between sections of the configuration and copy class names to your clipboard by clicking on them. \n\n**[Demo using the default Tailwind config](https://rogden.github.io/tailwind-config-viewer/)**\n\n## Installation\n\n### NPX\nRun `npx tailwind-config-viewer` from within the directory that contains your Tailwind configuration file.\n\n### Globally\n`npm i tailwind-config-viewer -g`\n\n### Locally\n`npm i tailwind-config-viewer -D`\n\nWhen installing locally, you can add an entry into the package.json scripts field to run and open the viewer:\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"tailwind-config-viewer\": \"tailwind-config-viewer -o\"\n}\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nRun the `tailwind-config-viewer` command from within the directory that contains your Tailwind configuration file.\n\n## Commands\n\n### serve (default)\n\nThe `serve` command is the default command. Running `tailwind-config-viewer` is the same as `tailwind-config-viewer serve`. \n\n**Options**\n\n|Option|Default|Description|\n|----|----|----|\n|-p, --port|`3000`|The port to run the viewer on. If occupied it will use next available port.|\n|-o, --open|`false`|Open the viewer in default browser|\n|-c, --config|`tailwind.config.js`|Path to your Tailwind config file|\n\n### export\n\nExports the viewer to a directory that can be uploaded to a static host. It accepts the output directory path as its sole argument. \n\n`tailwind-config-viewer export ./output-dir`\n\nIf an output directory isn't specificied it will be output to `tcv-build`.\n\n**Options**\n\n|Option|Default|Description|\n|----|----|----|\n|-c, --config|`tailwind.config.js`|Path to your Tailwind config file|\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou can declare a `configViewer` property in your Tailwind configuration's theme object in order to customize certain aspects of the config viewer.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  theme: {\n    // ...your Tailwind theme config\n    configViewer: {\n      // ... configViewer Options\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n### themeReplacements\n\nIn some instances you may want to replace values used in your Tailwind config when it is displayed in the config viewer. One scenario where this is necessary is when you are using CSS variables for your theme values:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  theme: {\n    colors: {\n      black: 'var(--color-black)'\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn order for the config viewer to properly display this color, you need to provide a replacement for it:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  theme: {\n    colors: {\n      black: 'var(--color-black)'\n    },\n    configViewer: {\n      themeReplacements: {\n        'var(--color-black)': '#000000'\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can replace any value in your theme for display in the config viewer by setting the corresponding `valueToFind: valueToReplace` in the `themeReplacements` object.\n\n### baseFontSize\n\nThe config viewer displays the pixel equivalent of any rem values. By default `baseFontSize` is set to 16 to mirror the default root element font size in most browsers. If you plan on using a different root font size in your project, you should set the value of `baseFontSize` to match.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  theme: {\n    // ...your Tailwind theme config\n    configViewer: {\n      baseFontSize: 20 // default is 16\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### typographyExample\n\nYou can change the default sentence used in the typography sections (Font Size, Letter Spacing etc.)\nby setting the `typographyExample` option:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  theme: {\n    // ...your Tailwind theme config\n    configViewer: {\n      typographyExample: 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### fonts\n\nYou can add custom fonts to the config viewer that are used in your Tailwind config by passing in a font url as a string, or an array of font urls.\n\n**Notes**\n\n* If multiple font weights are provided in a single url (see example) only the last weight will be used.\n* If fonts are in your Tailwind theme config but urls are not provided they will not display correctly (currently with no warning).\n* Fonts can only be provided via urls not local files. If this something you need, please open a ticket or a pull request.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  theme: {\n    // ...your Tailwind theme config\n    configViewer: {\n      // single font\n      fonts: \"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Open+Sans&display=swap\"\n      // or multiple fonts\n      fonts: [\n        \"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Open+Sans&display=swap\",\n        \"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@100;500&display=swap\" // <- only 500 will be used\n      ]\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Usage Tips\n\n- `Shift+Click` on the Tailwind class names to copy multiple to your clipboard at once\n\n## Roadmap\n\n- [x] Add static export \n- [x] Add Transition section\n- [x] Dark Mode toggle\n- [x] Add support for loading custom fonts / font family section",

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\r\n\r\n4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:\r\n\r\nYou must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\r\n\r\nYou must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and\r\n\r\nYou must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and\r\n\r\nIf the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\r\n\r\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\r\n\r\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\r\n\r\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\r\n\r\n8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\r\n9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n\r\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS",

Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

You need to include a [polyfill](https://github.com/w3c/IntersectionObserver/tree/master/polyfill) to make it work on incompatible browsers.**\n\n## Import\n\n```javascript\nimport Vue from 'vue'\nimport VueObserveVisibility from 'vue-observe-visibility'\n\nVue.use(VueObserveVisibility)\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```javascript\nimport Vue from 'vue'\nimport { ObserveVisibility } from 'vue-observe-visibility'\n\nVue.directive('observe-visibility', ObserveVisibility)\n```\n\n## Browser\n\n```html\n<script src=\"vue.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/vue-observe-visibility/dist/vue-observe-visibility.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nThe plugin should be auto-installed. If not, you can install it manually with the instructions below.\n\nInstall all the directives:\n\n```javascript\nVue.use(VueObserveVisibility)\n```\n\nUse specific directives:\n\n```javascript\nVue.directive('observe-visibility', VueObserveVisibility.ObserveVisibility)\n```\n\n# Usage\n\nThe `v-observe-visibility` directive is very easy to use. Just pass a function as the value:\n\n```html\n<div v-observe-visibility=\"visibilityChanged\">\n```\n\nThis also works on components:\n\n```html\n<MyComponent v-observe-visibility=\"visibilityChanged\" />\n```\n\nThe function will be called whenever the visiblity of the element changes with the argument being a boolean (`true` means the element is visible on the page, `false` means that it is not).\n\nThe second argument is the corresponding [IntersectionObserverEntry](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserverEntry) object.\n\n```javascript\nvisibilityChanged (isVisible, entry) {\n  this.isVisible = isVisible\n  console.log(entry)\n}\n```\n\n## IntersectionObserver options\n\nIt's possible to pass the [IntersectionObserver `options` object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/IntersectionObserver#Parameters) using the `intersection` attribute:\n\n```html\n<div v-observe-visibility=\"{\n  callback: visibilityChanged,\n  intersection: {\n    root: ...,\n    rootMargin: ...,\n    threshold: 0.3,\n  },\n}\">\n```\n\n## Once\n\nIt can be useful to listen for when the element is visible only once, for example to build introduction animations. Set the `once` option to `true`:\n\n```html\n<div v-observe-visibility=\"{\n  callback: visibilityChanged,\n  once: true,\n}\">\n```\n\n## Throttling visibility\n\nYou can use the `throttle` options (in ms) specifying minimal state duration after which an event will be fired. It's useful when you are tracking visibility while scrolling and don't want events from fastly scrolled out elements.\n\n```html\n<div v-observe-visibility=\"{\n  callback: visibilityChanged,\n  throttle: 300,\n}\">\n```\n\nYou can also pass a `leading` option to trigger the callback the first time when the visibility changes without waiting for the throttle delay.\nI can either be `visible`, `hidden` or `both`.\n\n```html\n<div v-observe-visibility=\"{\n  callback: visibilityChanged,\n  throttle: 300,\n  throttleOptions: {\n    leading: 'visible',\n  },\n}\">\n```\n\n## Passing custom arguments\n\nYou can add custom argument by using an intermediate function:\n\n```html\n<div v-observe-visibility=\"(isVisible, entry) => visibilityChanged(isVisible, entry, customArgument)\">\n```\n\nHere `visibilityChanged` will be call with a third custom argument `customArgument`.\n\n## Disabling the observer\n\nPassing a falsy value to the directive will disable the observer:\n\n```html\n<div\n  v-for=\"(item, index) of items\"\n  :key=\"item.id\"\n  v-observe-visibility=\"index === items.length - 1 ? visibilityChanged : false\"\n>\n```\n\n# Example\n\n```html\n<div id=\"app\">\n  <button @click=\"show = !show\">Toggle</button>\n  <label>\n    <input type=\"checkbox\" v-model=\"isVisible\" disabled/> Is visible?\n  </label>\n  <div ref=\"test\" v-show=\"show\" v-observe-visibility=\"visibilityChanged\">Hello world!</div>\n</div>\n\n<script>\nnew Vue({\n  el: '#app',\n  data: {\n    show: true,\n    isVisible: true,\n  },\n  methods: {\n    visibilityChanged (isVisible, entry) {\n      this.isVisible = isVisible\n      console.log(entry)\n    },\n  },\n})\n</script>\n```\n\n---\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)",

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS",
